# ESG Policy Framework

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting or updating an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) policy framework — the document that defines a company's commitments, governance structure, and reporting approach for ESG matters. ESG policy frameworks have moved from optional to near-mandatory for companies raising institutional capital, operating in regulated sectors, or listed on exchanges in the MENA region, EU, or UK.

Typical triggers:
- Institutional investor requires ESG policy before committing capital
- Company listing on ADX, DFM, Tadawul, or LSE where ESG disclosure is required
- PE or VC fund requires portfolio company to adopt ESG framework as a condition of investment
- Corporate governance audit identifies absence of formal ESG documentation
- Company wants to participate in sustainability indices (MSCI ESG, FTSE4Good) or tenders requiring ESG credentials

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Company name, sector, and jurisdiction | Affects which ESG standards and regulatory requirements apply | Ask |
| Stage of ESG maturity | Is this a first framework or an update? | Ask |
| Key ESG risks and opportunities for the business | The substance of the framework | Ask |
| Applicable regulatory requirements | CSRD, SFDR, SCA/UAE ESG guidance, KSA ESG rules, TCFD | Ask |
| Reporting framework target | GRI, SASB, ISSB/IFRS S1–S2, TCFD | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Carbon footprint / scope 1, 2, 3 emissions data (if available)
- Existing policies that will be integrated (EHS, community investment, anti-corruption)
- Sustainability commitments already made publicly
- Board-level ESG committee structure (or plan to establish one)
- Supply chain ESG requirements

## Document structure

### 1. Introduction and Commitment Statement

- Board-level statement of commitment to ESG principles
- Why ESG matters for this company: link to business strategy, stakeholder relationships, long-term value creation
- Scope of the framework: which entities, geographies, operations are covered
- Effective date and review cycle (typically annual)

### 2. Governance Structure

**Board oversight**:
- Which board committee has ESG oversight (audit committee, dedicated sustainability committee, or full board)?
- Board members' ESG qualifications / diversity commitments
- ESG performance metrics linked to executive compensation?

**Management responsibility**:
- Chief Sustainability Officer / ESG Director (if any)
- Sustainability team structure
- ESG working group (cross-functional: legal, finance, operations, HR, communications)

**Reporting and accountability**:
- Internal ESG reporting to board: frequency, format
- External ESG disclosure: annual sustainability report, integrated report, or regulatory filing

### 3. Environmental Pillar

**Climate and energy**:
- Net-zero target: year and scope (UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategy aligns with national ambition; KSA Vision 2030 includes 50% renewables by 2030)
- Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions inventory (aligned with GHG Protocol)
- Carbon reduction pathway: absolute reduction targets or intensity targets by year
- Renewable energy transition: % of energy from renewable sources; timeline
- TCFD alignment: disclosure of climate-related financial risks and opportunities

**Resource efficiency**:
- Water usage reduction targets (particularly relevant in water-scarce MENA)
- Waste management: reduction, recycling, circular economy commitments
- Responsible procurement: sustainable sourcing standards for key inputs

**Physical climate risk**:
- Assessment of physical climate risks (extreme heat, sea-level rise, water stress) on operations
- Adaptation measures for MENA-based operations (heat stress management for outdoor workers; cooling efficiency)

### 4. Social Pillar

**Workforce and human capital**:
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion: targets for gender diversity, nationality diversity (Emiratization / Saudization performance), and disability inclusion
- Living wage commitment
- Health and safety: target zero-harm; TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate) targets
- Training and development: hours of training per employee per year; career development investment
- Worker wellbeing: mental health programs; flexible working; employee assistance

**Supply chain and human rights**:
- Supplier code of conduct: ESG requirements for key suppliers
- Forced labor and child labor prohibition: explicit statement; supply chain audit program
- Conflict minerals / responsible sourcing (if applicable to sector)

**Community and stakeholder engagement**:
- Local community investment: percentage of pre-tax profit or fixed amount; geographic focus
- Stakeholder engagement: methodology for identifying and engaging key stakeholders
- Grievance mechanisms: how affected communities can raise concerns

**Customer and product responsibility**:
- Product safety and quality standards
- Responsible marketing (no misleading claims; fair pricing)
- Data privacy and cybersecurity (link to privacy policy)

### 5. Governance Pillar

**Board composition and independence**:
- Board diversity targets (gender, expertise, independence ratios)
- Director independence standards
- Succession planning for key roles

**Anti-corruption and business ethics**:
- Zero-tolerance policy for bribery, corruption, and facilitation payments
- Alignment with FCPA (for US-nexus companies), UK Bribery Act, and applicable local laws (UAE Anti-Corruption Law, KSA Anti-Bribery and Corruption Law)
- Gifts and hospitality policy
- Whistleblowing: confidential reporting channel; protection from retaliation
- Anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance

**Transparency and disclosure**:
- Regular ESG reporting (GRI Standards, ISSB/IFRS S1 and S2)
- Third-party assurance of ESG data (reasonable vs. limited assurance)
- Executive compensation linked to ESG KPIs

**Tax responsibility**:
- Commitment to paying the right amount of tax in the right jurisdiction
- Country-by-country reporting (if applicable threshold exceeded)
- No use of aggressive or abusive tax structures

### 6. ESG Reporting Framework Alignment

State which external frameworks the policy is aligned with:

| Framework | Coverage |
|---|---|
| **GRI Standards (Global Reporting Initiative)** | Comprehensive impact-based ESG reporting; most widely used globally |
| **SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)** | Industry-specific materiality standards |
| **TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)** | Climate risk governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics |
| **IFRS S1 / S2 (ISSB)** | Sustainability and climate-related financial disclosures — the new global standard (2024+) |
| **UN SDGs** | Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals where relevant |
| **GCC-specific**: SCA ESG Reporting Guidance (UAE) | UAE SCA requires ESG reporting from listed companies; guidance updated periodically |
| **Saudi Exchange ESG Reporting Guide** | Tadawul-listed companies; voluntary but increasingly expected |
| **EU CSRD** | Applicable to large EU entities and EU subsidiaries of non-EU parents above thresholds |

### 7. Materiality Assessment

Describe the process for identifying material ESG topics:
- Double materiality: impact on people/environment AND financial materiality to the company (EU CSRD standard)
- Stakeholder engagement: consultation with employees, investors, customers, community
- Peer benchmarking: comparison with industry ESG disclosures
- Output: materiality matrix identifying priority topics

### 8. Targets, KPIs, and Commitments

Provide specific, measurable commitments:

| ESG topic | Current baseline | Target | Year |
|---|---|---|---|
| GHG emissions (Scope 1+2) | [X tCO2e] | Net zero | 2050 / 2030 |
| Renewable energy | [X%] | 100% | [Year] |
| Gender diversity — senior management | [X%] | 40% female | [Year] |
| Lost-time injury rate | [X] | Zero harm | Ongoing |
| Employee training hours | [X hrs/employee] | [Target] | [Year] |

### 9. Caveats and Currency

ESG regulatory requirements are evolving rapidly. This policy framework should be reviewed annually against:
- MENA regulatory updates (UAE SCA guidance, Saudi Exchange guidance, Tadawul ESG requirements)
- ISSB standards updates
- EU CSRD phasing (applies to EU operations; supply chain requirements broaden over time)
- Applicable sanctions and conflict-minerals lists

## Common mistakes

- **Generic aspirational statements without targets**: "We are committed to the environment" without measurable commitments is dismissed by sophisticated investors; include specific, time-bound targets.
- **Forgetting Scope 3 emissions**: Supply chain emissions (Scope 3) are typically the largest source of GHG emissions for trading and manufacturing companies; omitting them understates the company's climate footprint.
- **No board-level ownership**: An ESG policy endorsed only by a CSR manager rather than the board does not signal genuine governance integration.
- **Misalignment with local regulatory requirements**: UAE SCA requirements for listed companies and KSA Exchange requirements are specific; the framework must address them, not just TCFD or GRI.
- **Claiming alignment with a framework without actual disclosure**: Stating "we align with GRI" without actually publishing GRI-aligned disclosures is greenwashing and creates regulatory and reputational risk.
