# Due Diligence Request List

## When to use this

Use this skill when buy-side counsel in an M&A transaction needs to prepare the initial (or supplemental) due diligence request list — the structured document request sent to the seller or its counsel to populate the virtual data room (VDR). The DDRL shapes the entire due diligence process; a well-structured list ensures comprehensive coverage and reduces follow-up rounds.

Typical triggers:
- LOI or term sheet signed; due diligence formally opened
- VDR has been established but is incomplete; supplemental requests needed
- First-round DDRL has been responded to; second-round targeted requests needed
- Sector-specific compliance diligence requires bespoke document categories

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Target company name | Identity and entity type affects what documents to request | Ask |
| Industry / sector | Drives sector-specific categories (financial, healthcare, technology, real estate, etc.) | Ask |
| Target's jurisdiction(s) of operation | Determines applicable regulatory and corporate law documents | Ask |
| Transaction structure (share purchase / asset purchase) | Asset purchase — focus on specific assets; share purchase — full company diligence | Ask |
| Deal timeline | Affects prioritization of initial vs. supplemental requests | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Known risks already identified (to prioritize certain categories)
- Whether a W&I insurer's requirements need to be met
- Whether competition/antitrust filing will be required (additional regulatory documents needed)
- Target's group structure (if subsidiaries are material, requests need to cover them)

A standard DDRL is organized into numbered sections. Each item is a specific category of documents.

## Jurisdictional notes

### MENA-specific items to add

| Jurisdiction | Additional document categories |
|---|---|
| **UAE** | Emirates ID and residency visa status of all sponsored employees; Tasheel records; UAE Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) register extract; Economic Substance Regulation (ESR) compliance records |
| **KSA** | Saudi Commercial Register; GOSI (social insurance) contribution records; Saudization (Nitaqat) compliance certificate; Hawkamah or CMA filings if listed or licensed |
| **Lebanon** | CNSS (NSSF) compliance records; Central Bank of Lebanon approvals if financial institution; corporate registry extract (extrait du registre de commerce) |
| **Egypt** | GAFI registration documents; Egyptian Tax Authority compliance certificate; EFSA filings if financial institution; Zakat returns (not applicable but confirm) |
| **DIFC / ADGM** | DIFC/ADGM Registrar of Companies extract; DFSA/FSRA licenses; DEWS (workplace savings) compliance records |

## Drafting standards

- Number all items hierarchically (1.1, 1.2, etc.) to allow seller to respond item by item.
- Include a document submission instructions cover page: VDR access instructions, response deadline, preferred format (native files vs. PDF), and redaction protocol.
- For sensitive items (personal data, key contracts), offer to accept redacted versions initially and request full versions after exclusivity is granted.
- Prioritize items in a "Priority 1" section for the first VDR upload; this accelerates the deal.

## Common mistakes

- **Too broad**: Asking for "all documents" generates an unmanageable VDR and unhelpful responses; be specific.
- **No deadline**: The DDRL must include a deadline for initial population of the VDR; open-ended requests stall deals.
- **Missing change-of-control sweep**: Failing to specifically request contracts with change-of-control triggers is one of the most costly oversights in M&A diligence.
- **Ignoring UBO requirements**: In UAE and GCC, UBO registers are mandatory; failure to confirm beneficial ownership chain is a compliance gap.
