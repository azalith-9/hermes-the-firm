# Full Legal Due Diligence Pack

## Purpose

This workflow orchestrates a complete legal due diligence exercise for acquisitions, equity investments, and financing transactions. It produces a structured DD report with per-workstream risk ratings, a critical findings memo, and a recommended list of actions (reps & warranties scope, specific indemnities, escrow requirements, and required pre-closing remediation).

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Target company name + jurisdiction | Yes | Drives applicable law for each workstream |
| Transaction type | Yes | Acquisition / equity investment / debt financing — affects scope |
| Materiality threshold | Yes | Tie to deal size: e.g., findings >$50k flagged; >$500k red |
| Data room access | Yes | All documents must be accessible before commencing |
| Deal timeline | Yes | Drives workstream prioritization and depth |
| Buyer's side priorities | Yes | Any specific areas of concern from acquirer |
| Exclusivity terms | Recommended | Know how much time is available |

---

## Logic — Workstream Overview

All ten workstreams run in parallel. Each produces: **RAG rating** (Green / Amber / Red) + **list of findings** + **recommended actions**.

### RAG Rating Criteria

| Rating | Meaning | Response |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Green | No material issues found | Confirm in rep |
| Amber | Issues present but manageable | Targeted indemnity or escrow; disclosure schedule note |
| Red | Material issue requiring action | Pre-closing remediation OR price adjustment OR walk-away |

## Workstream 1 — Corporate

**Scope**: legal existence and authority of the target

Checklist:
- [ ] Certificate of incorporation / trade license (current and valid)
- [ ] Memorandum and Articles of Association (current, consolidated version)
- [ ] Cap table — fully diluted; all share classes, options, warrants, convertible instruments
- [ ] Shareholder register — confirms legal ownership
- [ ] Board minutes — last 3 years; resolutions for major decisions; authorization trail
- [ ] Related-party transactions — arms-length? properly approved?
- [ ] Foreign ownership compliance — is the ownership structure compliant with the jurisdiction's FDI/foreign ownership rules?
- [ ] UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Ownership) disclosures — AML/regulatory requirement in UAE, KSA, DIFC
- [ ] Corporate group structure — any subsidiaries, JVs, branches?

**MENA-specific flags:**
- UAE mainland: foreign ownership restrictions still apply in certain sectors (check the Positive List under FDI Law); verify local partner arrangements
- KSA: foreign investment license required (MISA license); verify it is current and covers the actual business activity
- DIFC/ADGM: more flexible foreign ownership; verify regulated activity licenses (DFSA/FSRA) if applicable

---

## Workstream 2 — Commercial Contracts

**Scope**: material contracts that drive revenue or create obligations

Checklist:
- [ ] Top 20 contracts by revenue — check for change-of-control provisions (do they require consent on acquisition?)
- [ ] Assignability — can contracts be transferred to the acquirer without consent?
- [ ] Key customer contracts — concentration risk; auto-renewal vs. renegotiation risk
- [ ] Key supplier contracts — critical dependency? exclusivity?
- [ ] Exclusivity clauses — does the target have exclusivity obligations that restrict the acquirer's other business?
- [ ] Most-favored-nation (MFN) or pricing commitments
- [ ] Termination-for-convenience clauses — can customers exit quickly?
- [ ] Force majeure coverage — COVID/pandemic clauses; war clauses (relevant for MENA)
- [ ] Government contracts — procurement rules; anti-assignment; local content requirements

**Red flags:**
- Revenue concentration (>30% from a single customer who can terminate)
- Change-of-control provisions requiring third-party consent that may not be obtainable
- Unusual exclusivity or non-compete obligations that bind the acquirer

- [ ] License agreements (in) — any material IP licensed in? assignable on transaction?
- [ ] License agreements (out) — any IP licensed to third parties? exclusivity?

## Output — Due Diligence Report Structure

### Report Sections

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Transaction overview
   - Overall DD verdict (Green / Amber / Red at portfolio level)
   - Top 3–5 critical findings requiring buyer attention

2. **Critical Findings** (3 pages)
   - Each material issue: workstream, description, quantum, recommended action

3. **Workstream Sections** (5–10 pages each)
   - Per-workstream: RAG rating, findings list, recommended actions (indemnity / specific rep / escrow / pre-closing fix)

4. **Disclosure Schedule Recommendations**
   - Which items to flag for negotiation; what the seller needs to disclose against which reps

5. **Reps & Warranties Scoping**
   - Based on DD findings, areas where reps should be strengthened or where buyer should seek specific indemnities

6. **Post-Closing Actions Calendar**
   - Remediation items; filing deadlines; integration milestones

---

## Why This Matters

Legal due diligence converts transaction risk from unknown to quantified. Each workstream finding becomes an input to the deal structure: price adjustments, specific indemnities, escrow sizing, and earn-out conditions are all driven by DD output. A thorough DD also protects the buyer: knowledge of a defect at DD prevents it from ripening into a rep & warranty claim later.
