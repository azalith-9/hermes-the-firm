# E-Money License Application Memo

## When to use this

Use this skill when a fintech company, payment service provider, or digital wallet operator needs a structured legal memo analyzing the requirements for obtaining an e-money or payment institution license in a specific jurisdiction. The memo informs the business decision on where to incorporate, what entity structure to use, and what the regulatory timeline and costs are.

Typical triggers:
- Startup evaluating which MENA or EU jurisdiction to use as its primary regulated home
- Existing fintech seeking to expand licensed operations into a new market
- Investor requiring confirmation that target has a viable licensing pathway
- Counsel advising on the regulatory pre-conditions before launch

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Company name and current corporate structure | Identifies the applicant entity | Ask |
| Target jurisdiction(s) for the license | Each jurisdiction has different requirements | Ask |
| Business model description | E-money issuance, payment initiation, wallet, remittance, acquiring — each triggers different rules | Ask |
| Target launch timeline | Affects advice on jurisdiction selection (fast vs. thorough regimes) | Ask |
| Expected float / average outstanding e-money | Drives capital adequacy and safeguarding requirements | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Current capitalization (to assess gap vs. minimum capital requirements)
- Names and backgrounds of proposed directors and senior managers (fit-and-proper assessment)
- Proposed AML officer and compliance officer (key-person requirements)
- Existing technology infrastructure details
- Other jurisdictions where the company already holds licenses (passporting implications for EU)

## Memo structure

### 1. Executive Summary

- Jurisdiction recommended and rationale
- Estimated timeline from application to license issuance
- Minimum capital requirement
- Key conditions and deal-breakers

### 2. License Category and Scope

Define what type of license is required:
- E-money institution (EMI) license — permits issuance of e-money stored on devices or servers, payment execution
- Payment institution (PI) license — permits payment services but not e-money issuance
- Small EMI / limited license — reduced requirements for lower-value operators (available in some jurisdictions)

For each business activity (wallet, remittance, acquiring, lending), confirm which license category permits it.

### 3. Minimum Capital Requirements

| Jurisdiction | Minimum initial capital | Ongoing capital requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **EU (EMD2)** | EUR 350,000 for EMI; EUR 20,000–125,000 for PI depending on service category | Higher of minimum or 2% of average outstanding e-money |
| **UK (EMI)** | GBP 350,000 | Same methodology as EU; FCA applies own liquidity guidance |
| **UAE (CBUAE)** | AED 50 million for full payment service license; tiered for limited/stored value | As prescribed by CBUAE Retail Payment Services and Card Schemes Regulation |
| **DIFC (DFSA)** | USD 500,000 for Authorised Firm (Providing Money Services) | As prescribed by DFSA Rulebook (GEN Module) |
| **ADGM (FSRA)** | Determined by FSRA based on risk profile; typically USD 200,000+ | FSRA Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 |
| **KSA (SAMA)** | SAR 50 million for payment services company; lower for fintech sandbox participants | As prescribed by SAMA Payment Services Provider Regulations |
| **Lebanon (BdL)** | Per BdL Circular (e-payments framework); BdL has issued specific circulars for payment institutions | BdL Basic Circular 1 and related circulars; capital requirements periodically updated |
| **Egypt (CBE)** | Determined by CBE per Payment Systems and Digital Transactions Law (Law No. 18 of 2019) | CBE regulations set minimum capital and solvency requirements |

Note: Confirm all figures directly with the regulator or local counsel before relying on them — capital thresholds are subject to regulatory update.

### 4. Governance Requirements

- Minimum number of directors; required independence
- Fit-and-proper requirements for directors and senior managers (criminal record checks, financial history, competence)
- Required senior management roles: CEO, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer), CTO (sometimes)
- Board-level risk and audit committees (usually required for larger EMIs)
- Minimum UAE/KSA national representation on board (in some MENA jurisdictions)

### 5. AML/KYC Obligations

All e-money license regimes impose AML/CFT obligations aligned with FATF 40 Recommendations:
- Customer due diligence (CDD) — standard, simplified, and enhanced
- Suspicious transaction reporting (STR) to the Financial Intelligence Unit
- Transaction monitoring systems
- Sanctions screening (OFAC, UN, EU, local lists)
- Record retention (typically 5–10 years)
- MLRO appointment and reporting obligations

**MENA specifics**:
- UAE: UAE AML Law (Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2018); CBUAE Guidance; goAML system for STR filing
- KSA: Anti-Money Laundering Law (Royal Decree M/31) and its implementing regulations; SAMA oversight
- Lebanon: Special Investigation Commission (SIC) — independent; Law No. 318 of 2001 on money laundering; severe consequences for non-compliance
- Egypt: Anti-Money Laundering Law (Law No. 80 of 2002, as amended) and CBE/FIU oversight

### 6. Safeguarding Requirements

E-money institutions must safeguard customer funds — they must be segregated from own funds and protected in insolvency:

- **EU/UK model**: Segregation in dedicated bank accounts or investment in low-risk liquid assets; insurance alternative available
- **CBUAE model**: Specific safeguarding rules in the Retail Payment Services and Card Schemes Regulation; funds must be held with a UAE bank
- **SAMA/KSA**: Segregated accounts at licensed Saudi banks required
- **DIFC/ADGM**: Trust account or equivalent arrangement

### 7. Application Process and Timeline

| Step | Description | Typical duration |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-application / regulatory engagement | Initial meeting with regulator to discuss business model; some regulators offer pre-application meetings | 1–4 weeks |
| Application preparation | Drafting application form, business plan, financial projections, policies | 4–12 weeks |
| Application submission | Submission with filing fee | Day 1 |
| Completeness review | Regulator checks application is complete; may issue queries | 2–8 weeks |
| Substantive review | Fit-and-proper assessment; business model review; AML/governance review | 3–12 months |
| License issuance | Conditional or full license granted | License effective from issuance date |

**UAE (CBUAE)** timeline: approximately 6–12 months for a full payment services license. Fintech regulatory sandbox available for eligible companies (faster path to operating, limited scope).

**DIFC (DFSA)**: Typically 3–6 months; DFSA has a streamlined process for innovation testing license.

**EU (national NCA)**: Varies by member state; Lithuania, Malta, and Ireland have developed reputations as faster EMI licensing jurisdictions (typically 3–6 months); some NCAs take 12–18 months.

**UK (FCA)**: EMI authorization typically 12–18 months; FCA increased scrutiny post-2019; applications must be complete and thorough.

### 8. Regulatory Sandbox Options

Several MENA regulators offer sandbox programs that allow limited operation before full licensing:
- **UAE (CBUAE Fintech Office)**: Regulatory sandbox for innovative payment solutions
- **DIFC (Innovation Hub)**: FinTech regulatory sandbox with DFSA Innovation Testing License
- **ADGM (RegLab)**: FSRA's regulatory laboratory for fintech
- **KSA (SAMA Fintech Lab)**: Saudi Central Bank sandbox
- **Bahrain (CBB FinTech)**: Regional sandbox hub

Sandboxes provide 6–24 months of regulatory accommodation; they are a valuable first step for companies without prior financial services regulatory history.

## Common mistakes

- **Underestimating the capital requirement gap**: Many applicants discover they are undercapitalized after beginning the application process; confirm the figure early.
- **Weak MLRO/compliance function**: Regulators will reject applications without a credible, experienced Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO); this person must be identified and committed before applying.
- **Generic business plan**: Regulators require a detailed 3-year financial model and a thorough description of the compliance and risk framework; template business plans are rejected.
- **Ignoring passporting**: EU-based EMIs can passport their license into other EEA member states via notification; this is much faster and cheaper than seeking separate national licenses.
- **Wrong entity type**: In some jurisdictions (KSA, UAE), the applicant must be a locally incorporated company; foreign branches or offshore entities are not eligible for certain license categories.
