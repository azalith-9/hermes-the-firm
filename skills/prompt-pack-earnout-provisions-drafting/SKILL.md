# Earnout Provisions Drafting

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting the earnout section of an M&A agreement (SPA, APA, or merger agreement). Earnouts allow part of the purchase price to be contingent on the target's post-closing performance, bridging the valuation gap when buyer and seller disagree on what the business is worth. They are common in:

- Technology acquisitions (key metric: ARR, MRR, or active users)
- Healthcare and pharma (key metric: regulatory approval milestones, revenue)
- Professional services (key metric: revenue retention from key clients)
- Startups and growth companies with forward-looking valuations

Earnouts are also among the most litigated provisions in M&A — the drafting must be precise.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Maximum earnout amount | The ceiling of contingent consideration | Ask |
| Earnout metrics | Revenue, EBITDA, gross profit, ARR, milestone-based — must be defined precisely | Ask in detail |
| Measurement period(s) | Annual, quarterly, multi-year — and the exact start/end dates | Ask |
| Accounting principles | IFRS, US GAAP, local GAAP — and which party's auditors apply | Ask |
| Operating covenant obligations on buyer post-closing | What the buyer must/must not do to avoid manipulating the earnout | Critical; ask |
| Dispute resolution mechanism for earnout disputes | Accountant expert, arbitration, courts | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Earnout structure: cumulative vs. independent annual periods
- Catch-up provisions (shortfall in Year 1 can be made up in Year 2)
- Accelerated earnout triggers (change of control post-closing; seller's termination)
- Anti-embarrassment provisions (if buyer sells target within earnout period at a higher multiple, seller shares in excess value)
- Equity vs. cash payment of earnout
- Treatment of earnout on death or incapacity of the seller key person

## Document structure

### 1. Definitions

Define every term used in the earnout provisions with precision:
- **Earnout Consideration**: the contingent payment, expressed as a formula (e.g., 2x the amount by which EBITDA exceeds USD X)
- **Earnout Period**: specific start and end dates; fiscal year or calendar year
- **Earnout Metrics**: define the specific financial or operational metrics
  - If revenue: gross or net? exclude which items (returns, taxes, intercompany)?
  - If EBITDA: define adjustments (management fees, extraordinary items, buyer's shared services allocation?)
  - If ARR: which contracts qualify? minimum contract value? annual contracts only or monthly normalized?
- **Accounting Principles**: IFRS or US GAAP; consistently applied by whom; define what "consistently applied" means
- **Earnout Statement**: the document the buyer prepares at end of each period

### 2. Earnout Calculation

Specify the formula:

> "The Earnout Consideration for each Earnout Year shall be an amount equal to [formula], provided that the total Earnout Consideration payable in respect of all Earnout Years shall not exceed [maximum amount]."

- Tiered earnouts: "25% payable if EBITDA exceeds X; 50% if EBITDA exceeds Y; 100% if EBITDA exceeds Z"
- Binary milestone earnouts: "USD X payable on achievement of [regulatory approval / customer contract signature / product launch]"
- Hybrid: financial threshold + strategic milestone

### 3. Earnout Statement Process

1. Buyer prepares and delivers the Earnout Statement within [30–60] days after end of each Earnout Period
2. Statement must include the calculation in sufficient detail for the Seller to verify
3. Seller has [20–30] days to review; may deliver a Notice of Disagreement specifying items disputed
4. Parties negotiate resolution for [15–20] days after Notice of Disagreement
5. Unresolved disputes referred to an Independent Accountant (not buyer's or seller's auditors); decision is final and binding
6. Costs of Independent Accountant: borne by the party whose position is further from the final determination (or split equally)

### 4. Payment

- Payment due within [10–20] business days after Earnout Statement becomes final
- Set-off: buyer may set off against earnout only against finally determined (not disputed) indemnity claims
- Interest on late payment: [rate] from due date

### 5. Operating Covenants (Critical)

The most heavily negotiated section — the buyer's obligations to avoid "sandbagging" the earnout:

**Buyer must**:
- Operate the target in the ordinary course of business consistent with pre-closing practice
- Fund the business with adequate working capital
- Not divert revenue-generating opportunities away from the target
- Maintain the target's separate legal existence (if applicable)
- Not impose management fees, royalties, or charges on the target that reduce the earnout metric

**Buyer must not**:
- Merge the target into another group entity in a way that makes the earnout metric unmeasurable
- Materially change the accounting policies applied to the target without consent
- Change the target's fiscal year end
- Reduce pricing of target's products/services in a way that depresses the earnout metric

**Seller may request**:
- Periodic reporting rights (quarterly management accounts)
- Observer rights on the target's board during the earnout period
- Dispute rights if buyer takes actions that materially affect the earnout

### 6. Acceleration Events

Define circumstances in which the full earnout accelerates and becomes payable immediately:
- Buyer undergoes a change of control post-closing
- Buyer terminates the seller's employment or services agreement (if seller is also an employee) without cause
- Buyer materially breaches the operating covenant obligations
- Target is sold, wound up, or merged during the earnout period

### 7. Dispute Resolution

- Accountant expert determination is preferred for financial metric disputes (fast, binding, cost-efficient)
- Milestone disputes (was the milestone achieved?) may go to arbitration
- Specify the expert appointment mechanism: agreed list, or nominated by [ICAEW President / AICPA] if parties cannot agree within [10] days

## Jurisdictional notes

### Civil-law jurisdictions (UAE onshore, KSA, Lebanon, Egypt)

Civil-law courts may characterize earnout obligations as conditional obligations or contingent debts. Key considerations:
- The condition must be possible, legal, and clearly defined — vague metrics will not be enforced
- Court-appointed experts in civil-law systems may not apply the same accounting precision as Big-4 independent accountants in common-law systems; contract for independent accountant determination
- Penalty clause rules: in most MENA civil-law jurisdictions, courts can reduce penalties and damages to equitable levels; earnout provisions are not penalties but are sometimes treated analogously; use precise formula rather than penalty language

### DIFC / ADGM / UK (common law)

- Earnout obligations are enforceable as contractual debt obligations
- Operating covenants will be interpreted strictly; buyer must not take "unreasonable steps" to prevent earnout achievement (implied duty of good faith in DIFC law)
- Expert determination clauses are final and binding unless manifestly wrong (high bar to challenge)

### US

- Delaware courts apply strict construction to earnout provisions; ambiguity in metrics has historically been resolved against the party that drafted the contract
- Operating covenant disputes are a major source of post-closing M&A litigation
- Consider using financial metrics defined by reference to GAAP rather than IFRS for US deals

## Common mistakes

- **Vague metric definitions**: "Revenue" without defining inclusions/exclusions leads to the most earnout disputes. Every dollar in or out of the metric must be explicitly addressed.
- **No accounting principles specification**: If the buyer changes from IFRS to US GAAP post-closing, the earnout metric changes; pin down the exact accounting framework.
- **Insufficient operating covenants**: Buyers who divert business opportunities or charge management fees without covenants face no contractual liability; sellers need robust protections.
- **Set-off risk**: Allowing set-off against earnout for any disputed indemnity claim gives buyer an incentive to manufacture or over-claim indemnity claims to avoid paying the earnout.
- **No acceleration on buyer's change of control**: If the buyer is acquired post-closing, the earnout obligation may be assignable and the new owner may have no interest in achieving it.
