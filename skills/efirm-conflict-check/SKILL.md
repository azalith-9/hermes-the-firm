# eFirm: Conflict Check

## When to use this

A conflict check is **mandatory** before any of the following:
- Accepting a new client or new matter.
- Assigning a new lawyer to an existing matter (the new lawyer may bring conflicts from their prior firm).
- A lateral hire joins the firm (screens their prior client list against the firm's).
- A client's matter scope changes materially (new adverse parties, new jurisdictions, new issues).
- A potential conflict is reported by any member of the firm.

**Never begin substantive work without completing the conflict check.** Failure to do so is a malpractice and bar-discipline issue in every covered jurisdiction.

## Inputs

| Input | Why required |
|---|---|
| New client name (legal / trading) | Core search term |
| New client corporate group and parent entities | Conflicts extend to group companies |
| New client UBOs (where known) | Positional conflicts may arise with individuals |
| All counterparties (adverse parties) | The most direct source of conflict |
| Counterparty corporate groups + UBOs | Groups must be searched, not just the named entity |
| Related parties (witnesses, lenders, advisers) | Potential issue conflicts |
| Matter description (type + subject matter) | Needed for issue-conflict analysis |
| Proposed team members (all timekeepers) | Each member must be screened individually |

## Six search dimensions

### 1. Adverse-party conflicts

Has the firm **currently or historically** represented any person or entity that is now an adverse party?

- Search firm's client database for all variations of each adverse party's name.
- Include corporate predecessor names, former names, and known aliases.
- Include affiliated entities (parent, subsidiary, sister company).
- **Result trigger**: Any positive match → conflict concern.

### 2. Current-client conflicts

Would accepting the new matter place the firm adverse to a **current active client** on any matter?

- Being adverse to a current client — even on an unrelated matter — is a concurrent conflict under ABA 1.7 and analogous rules.
- "Positional adversity" (arguing a legal position for one client that contradicts a position argued for another client in another forum) can also be a concurrent conflict, though the threshold is higher.
- **Result trigger**: Any active-client adversity → conflict, not merely concern.

### 3. Former-client conflicts (substantially related test)

Is the new matter **substantially related** to a matter on which the firm previously represented a now-adverse party?

Under ABA 1.9 and equivalent rules:
- A matter is "substantially related" if it involves the same transaction or legal dispute, or if there is a substantial risk that confidential information obtained in the prior representation could be used to the prior client's material disadvantage.
- Time since representation is relevant but does not cure the conflict automatically.
- **Result trigger**: Substantially related former representation → conflict.

### 4. Issue / positional conflicts

Would accepting the matter require the firm to take a legal position that directly contradicts a position it has advanced for another client in another proceeding or jurisdiction?

- Most sensitive in appellate, regulatory, and legislative advocacy.
- Requires substantive analysis of the legal questions in both matters.
- **Result trigger**: Direct positional contradiction on a material question of law → concern requiring partner judgment.

### 5. Personal-interest conflicts

Does any proposed team member have a personal, family, financial, or other interest that could affect their professional judgment on this matter?

Common examples:
- Family member is an officer of the adverse party.
- Attorney holds equity in a client or counterparty.
- Attorney is personally named as a witness or potential defendant.
- Attorney has a personal relationship with a key decision-maker at the counterparty.

- **Result trigger**: Any personal interest that could materially limit representation → conflict or concern.

### 6. Material-limitation conflicts

Would representation of the new client be **materially limited** by the firm's responsibilities to another client, a former client, a third person, or the lawyer's own interests?

This is the catch-all prong. Examples:
- The firm has a standing arrangement with a lender that could affect advice given to a borrower.
- A co-counsel relationship creates cross-obligations.
- A referral source expects favorable treatment.

- **Result trigger**: Any material limitation → concern requiring partner review.

## Output schema

```
CONFLICT CHECK RESULT — [New Client] vs [Matter Description] — [Date]

RESULT: [CLEAN | CONCERN | CONFLICT]

By dimension:
  1. Adverse-party check:          [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]
  2. Current-client check:         [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]
  3. Former-client check:          [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]
  4. Issue/positional check:       [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]
  5. Personal-interest check:      [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]
  6. Material-limitation check:    [Clean / Concern / Conflict — details]

DETAILS ON ANY CONCERN OR CONFLICT:
  [Matter / client name]
  [Nature of the conflict or concern]
  [Governing rule reference]
  [Whether waivable — see below]

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
  Clean:    Proceed. Record this check in the matter file.
  Concern:  Route to conflicts partner for decision before proceeding.
  Conflict: Cannot proceed without waiver (if waivable) OR cannot proceed at all.
```

## Waiver framework

Some conflicts are **consentable** — they can be cured with the informed written consent of all affected clients. Others are **non-consentable** — no consent cures the conflict.

### Consentable conflicts (general rule)

A concurrent conflict is consentable if:
1. The lawyer reasonably believes they can provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client.
2. The representation is not prohibited by law.
3. The representation does not involve asserting a claim by one client against another in the same proceeding.
4. Each affected client gives informed written consent.

### Non-consentable conflicts (examples)

- Directly adverse representation of two clients in the same proceeding.
- Representation materially adverse to a former client on a substantially related matter where confidential information cannot be screened.
- Situations where the lawyer's own interests are so adverse that competent representation is impossible.

### Waiver drafting

Consent waivers require:
- Clear identification of the conflict.
- Explanation of the risks of dual representation.
- The client's alternatives (separate counsel).
- An unambiguous written consent signed by each affected client.

The waiver itself must be reviewed by the conflicts partner, not the matter-handling lawyer.

## Bar-rule quick reference

| Jurisdiction | Key rules | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| US (ABA) | Model Rules 1.7 (concurrent), 1.8 (specific), 1.9 (former client), 1.10 (imputation) | State rules vary; check state-specific version |
| Lebanon | Beirut Bar Code of Ethics, Art. [conflict articles] | Civil-law tradition; bar ethics council oversees |
| KSA | Code of Law Practice (Royal Decree M/38) | Emphasis on loyalty and non-adversity; Sharia-law ethical overlay |
| UAE onshore | Federal Law No. 23 of 1991 (Advocacy) + Bar rules | |
| DIFC | DIFC Rules of Conduct | Common-law framework closely tracking UK/ABA norms |
| ADGM | ADGM Rules of Conduct | Similar to DIFC |
| UK | SRA Code of Conduct 2019, Conflict Rules | Conflict of interest (own interest and client vs. client) |

## Imputation and screening

When a conflicted lawyer joins a new firm (lateral), their conflict is **imputed** to the entire new firm under most bar rules. A **Chinese wall** (ethical screen) can cure the imputation in many (but not all) jurisdictions if:
- The screen is timely erected (before any confidential information is shared).
- The screened lawyer receives no part of the fee.
- Written notice is given to the affected former client.

DIFC and ADGM explicitly permit screening to rebut imputation; US rules vary by state; UK SRA permits screens in some circumstances.

## Critical reminder

Conflict check completion must be **recorded with a timestamp and outcome** in the matter file. The check should be repeated if new parties emerge during the matter. A single check at intake is not sufficient for complex, long-running matters.
