# Third-Party Data Sharing Agreement

## When to use this

Use this skill when two or more independent organizations need a contractual framework governing their exchange of personal data — for example:

- A bank sharing KYC data with an insurance affiliate for joint product underwriting
- A government agency sharing civil records with an authorized data-analytics vendor
- Two companies in a joint venture sharing employee or customer data across their boundary
- A company receiving data from a third-party data broker for marketing enrichment

This is distinct from a vendor DPA (processor arrangement) because both parties may act as independent controllers, or one party may receive data as a secondary controller rather than a pure processor. The agreement must expressly allocate controller/processor status, legal basis, and data subject obligations.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Party A full legal name + registered address | Identifies the data discloser; determines applicable law | Prompt user |
| Party B full legal name + registered address | Identifies the data recipient | Prompt user |
| Description of personal data to be shared | Defines the scope and sensitivity; triggers special-category rules | Prompt user |
| Purposes for which data will be shared | Legal basis depends on purpose; limits onward use | Prompt user |
| Controller / processor designation for each party | Changes the entire obligation structure | Determine from context — if B has discretion over purpose, it is a controller |
| Governing law | Determines which data protection regime applies | Jurisdiction where data subjects are located, or where primary controller is established |

## Optional inputs

- **Data subject categories** (employees, customers, patients, children) — children's data triggers heightened obligations under every MENA and EU regime
- **Frequency and volume** (one-time transfer vs. ongoing API feed) — affects security and incident response commitments
- **Sensitive / special categories** (health, financial, biometric, criminal) — explicit safeguards required
- **Sub-sharing permissions** — whether B may further share with its own processors or affiliates
- **Retention schedule** — how long each party holds the shared data
- **Technical transfer mechanism** (API, SFTP, encrypted USB, data room)
- **Applicable certification standards** (ISO 27001, SOC 2)

## Document structure

1. **Definitions** — "Personal Data," "Controller," "Processor," "Data Subject," "Processing," "Security Incident," "Applicable Law" (list each jurisdiction instrument)
2. **Purpose and scope of data sharing** — enumerate dataset fields; state purpose limitation explicitly; include negative covenant against use for other purposes
3. **Legal basis for sharing** — each party must identify its legal basis independently (consent, contract performance, legitimate interests, legal obligation, vital interests, public task); if relying on legitimate interests, include a brief balancing test narrative
4. **Controller / processor designations** — table or clause assigning role of each party for each data stream; a party may be controller for one stream and processor for another
5. **Data subject rights obligations** — which party responds to access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection requests; response timeline; cost allocation; cooperation obligations when a request touches the other party's data
6. **Security obligations** — minimum technical and organizational measures (TOM clause); incident notification timeline (72 hours under GDPR; UAE PDPL requires notification "without undue delay"; KSA PDPL requires notification within 72 hours to SDAIA and affected individuals); joint incident response obligations
7. **Cross-border transfer mechanisms** — standard contractual clauses (EU SCCs or equivalents), adequacy decisions, binding corporate rules; UAE PDPL requires TDRA approval for certain transfers; KSA PDPL requires transfers to jurisdictions with adequate protection or SDAIA-approved mechanisms
8. **Permitted onward sharing** — whitelist of permitted sub-processors / sub-recipients; prohibition on further sharing without prior written consent
9. **Retention and deletion** — party-specific retention schedules; certified deletion or return of data on termination
10. **Audit rights** — right to audit or request compliance certification; frequency; notice period; cost allocation
11. **Liability and indemnification** — each party liable for its own non-compliance; mutual indemnification for regulatory fines caused by the other; liability cap (typically annual fees or fixed amount)
12. **Term and termination** — initial term; survival of data protection obligations; termination for material breach; obligations on expiry
13. **Governing law and dispute resolution** — choice of court or arbitration; if MENA parties, specify Arabic as governing language or state that English prevails in case of conflict
14. **Schedules** — Schedule A: Data inventory (fields, volumes, sensitivity); Schedule B: Technical and organizational measures; Schedule C: Approved sub-recipients

## Jurisdictional notes

| Jurisdiction | Key instrument | Notable requirement |
|---|---|---|
| UAE (onshore) | UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 45/2021 on Personal Data Protection (PDPL) | Requires TDRA registration for certain processing activities; cross-border transfers require TDRA approval unless adequate country; special categories (health, financial, children) have heightened requirements |
| DIFC | DIFC Data Protection Law 2020 (DP Law No. 5 of 2020) | Common-law framework modelled on GDPR; DPO mandatory for large-scale or sensitive processing; SCCs available for international transfers |
| ADGM | ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 | Also GDPR-modelled; accountability principle emphasized; joint controller agreements must allocate obligations in writing |
| KSA | Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) / Royal Decree M/19 (2021); implementing regulations 2023 | Sensitive data = health, genetic, biometric, financial, children, criminal; cross-border transfer to SDAIA-approved countries or via SDAIA-approved mechanisms; breach notification within 72 hours |
| Lebanon | Draft Personal Data Protection Law (not yet in force as of 2026); Law 81/2018 on e-transactions applies indirectly | Consult applicable sectoral law (banking secrecy Law 3/1956, medical records) until national law enacted |
| Egypt | Personal Data Protection Law No. 151/2020 and Implementing Regulations 2020 | Data Protection Authority approval required for certain cross-border transfers; privacy impact assessment required for high-risk processing |
| EU / GDPR | GDPR Art. 26 (joint controllers must conclude arrangement allocating obligations) | Joint controllers must make a joint controller agreement "essence" available to data subjects; each remains independently liable |
| UK | UK GDPR + Data Protection Act 2018 | Post-Brexit: UK SCCs (IDTA) for transfers to non-adequate countries |

**Civil-law trap (LB, EG, KSA onshore):** US-style indemnification clauses referencing "consequential damages" may be unenforceable or read down by civil law courts under general tort principles. Draft liability provisions referencing foreseeable direct damages.

**Language trap:** In KSA and UAE onshore, Arabic-language versions of contracts may prevail in court if not expressly subordinated to an English version. For dual-language data sharing agreements, include a "governing language" clause stating which version prevails.

## Drafting standards

- **Purpose limitation** must be explicit and narrow. Avoid drafting broad purposes such as "business operations" — regulators (particularly DIFC PDID and UAE TDRA) scrutinize vague purpose statements.
- **No `[INSERT X]` artifacts in final output** unless a template was specifically requested. Populate all defined terms based on user inputs.
- **Security annex** should specify concrete measures: encryption at rest (AES-256), in transit (TLS 1.2+), access control (role-based, MFA), pseudonymization where applicable, regular penetration testing.
- **Incident notification** clauses must match the shortest timeline among the applicable regimes (often 72 hours); build in an internal escalation chain.
- **Retention schedule** should be a table with field-level or dataset-level retention periods, not a single blanket period.
- Call out defaults at the top of the draft (e.g., "Governing law: UAE Federal unless otherwise specified").

## Common mistakes

- **Misclassifying a controller as a processor** — if Party B decides how to use the data, it is a controller; a processor only processes on documented instructions
- **Omitting Article 26 GDPR / equivalent joint controller clause** — required when two or more controllers jointly determine purposes and means
- **Vague purpose statements** — "improving services" is not a valid purpose limitation
- **Missing sub-processor whitelist** — GDPR and DIFC require written authorization; unlimited permission is disfavored
- **US-style consequential damages waiver without civil-law review** — may be void under Lebanese or Egyptian civil codes
- **Ignoring Arabic language requirement** — KSA and UAE consumer contracts often require an Arabic version
- **No data breach cooperation clause** — both parties need coordinated notification obligations when they share the same dataset
