# Inst — Legal Aid Routing

## Purpose

Legal aid routing connects individuals who cannot access paid legal counsel to free or subsidized services: government legal aid schemes, bar association clinics, court-appointed defense, specialized NGOs, and international organizations. This skill is a core access-to-justice function — it operates whenever Louis detects that a user's legal need is urgent and affordability or vulnerability is a barrier.

---

## When to use this

- User explicitly says they cannot afford a lawyer
- User asks "where can I get free legal help" or equivalent in Arabic, French, English
- Matter involves an individual (not a business) facing housing eviction, criminal charge, domestic violence, wage theft, or immigration status
- User is identified (or self-identifies) as a refugee, asylum seeker, or stateless person
- Emergency flag: user mentions detention, arrest, imminent deportation, or physical safety risk
- Downstream from [[justice-human-handoff]] when handoff requires a free resource

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User's country / emirate / governorate | Yes | Determines which programs apply |
| Legal issue type | Yes | Family / housing / criminal / labor / immigration / other |
| User vulnerability profile | Yes | Low-income / refugee / DV victim / detained / minor |
| Urgency level | Yes | Emergency (24h) / Standard (days-weeks) |
| Language preference | Optional | Arabic / English / French; affects which resources to surface |

---

## Logic

### Step 1: Jurisdiction detection
Map user location to available programs:
- **KSA** → Ministry of Justice legal aid + bar-appointed counsel + specialized programs
- **UAE** → Ministry of Justice legal aid + emirate-level centers + Dubai/Abu Dhabi mediation
- **LB** → Beirut Bar + Tripoli Bar clinics + NGO ecosystem
- **EG** → Egyptian Bar Syndicate bureaus + NGO + court-appointed defense
- **Cross-border / stateless** → UNHCR regional offices + international human rights organizations

### Step 2: Issue type categorization
| Issue Type | Priority Programs |
|---|---|
| Criminal defense (detained) | Court-appointed counsel; emergency bar duty solicitor |
| Family (divorce, custody, domestic violence) | Bar clinics; DV shelters with legal arms; family courts' free advice desks |
| Housing / eviction | Tenancy courts' mediation services; bar clinics; community legal centers |
| Labor / wage theft | Ministry of Labor complaints; labor court free representation (KSA, UAE) |
| Immigration / asylum / refugee | UNHCR + IOM + local partners; specialized immigration legal aid |
| Consumer / debt | Bar clinics; financial ombudsman (UAE: Central Bank; KSA: SAMA) |

### Step 3: Vulnerability amplifiers
Increase routing priority and surface emergency contacts when:
- User mentions physical danger, abuse, or threats
- User is a minor (under 18)
- User is detained or facing imminent court appearance
- User is a refugee or stateless (route to UNHCR first)
- User has language barrier beyond Arabic/French/English

### Step 4: Resource output
Return structured list:
1. Primary resource (most suitable program)
2. Secondary resource (backup / alternative)
3. Emergency hotline if urgency = emergency
4. Intake steps (documents needed, how to apply)
5. Estimated wait time where known

## Emergency protocols

If urgency = emergency (arrest, detention, imminent deportation, active DV, self-harm):
1. Surface emergency hotline number first (before any routing)
2. Advise user of their immediate rights (right to remain silent, right to counsel, right to notify family)
3. Provide duty-solicitor / on-call bar contact for jurisdiction
4. Only then provide full legal aid routing
5. Log handoff flag for [[justice-human-handoff]]
