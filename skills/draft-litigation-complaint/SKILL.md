# Litigation Complaint / Statement of Claim

## When to use this

Use this skill when a party is initiating court proceedings to assert a civil or commercial claim. The complaint / statement of claim is the pleading that starts the lawsuit: it identifies the parties, the court, the cause(s) of action, the material facts, and the relief sought.

This skill covers both:
- **Common-law style** complaints (DIFC Courts, ADGM Courts, English Courts, US Federal/State Courts)
- **Civil-law style** statements of claim (UAE federal courts, KSA courts, Lebanese courts, Egyptian courts, French courts)

Before drafting, confirm:
- The applicable statute of limitations has not expired
- The chosen court has subject-matter and personal jurisdiction
- The correct venue (local court) has been identified
- Court fees have been calculated and payment arranged

For arbitration commencement instead of court proceedings, use [[draft-notice-of-arbitration]].

## Common-law style complaint (DIFC / ADGM / UK / US)

### Structure

1. **Caption**
   - Court name and division
   - Case number (assigned on filing)
   - Plaintiff(s) vs Defendant(s)
   - Document title ("Claim Form and Particulars of Claim" / "Complaint")

2. **Introduction / overview** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - One-paragraph summary of the dispute
   - Stakes: amount in controversy and nature of relief
   - Strong opening framing (factual, not argument-forward)

3. **Parties**
   - For each party: full name, entity type, jurisdiction of formation, principal place of business / address
   - Basis for personal jurisdiction over each Defendant

4. **Jurisdiction and venue**
   - Subject-matter jurisdiction basis (commercial claim ≥ AED X; DIFC nexus; etc.)
   - Personal jurisdiction basis (contract performed in jurisdiction; defendant incorporated here; etc.)
   - Proper venue

5. **Factual allegations** (numbered paragraphs)
   - Chronological narrative
   - Each material fact in a separate numbered paragraph
   - Cross-reference exhibits by exhibit letter
   - Avoid argument; plead facts, not characterizations
   - Identify the relevant contract, clause, date, and breach precisely

6. **Causes of action** (separately pleaded counts)
   - Each cause of action is a separate count with its own heading
   - Each count: re-alleges prior factual allegations, identifies the legal basis, applies facts to elements, pleads that Defendant breached / is liable
   - In DIFC/ADGM: DIFC Contract Law, DIFC Law of Obligations — cite to specific provisions
   - In UK: cause of action at common law / equity; specific statute if applicable
   - Common commercial causes of action: breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligence, unjust enrichment, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty

7. **Damages**
   - Quantify all ascertainable losses with supporting calculation
   - For unliquidated damages: plead "in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than USD X"
   - Special damages (direct, specific losses): itemize
   - General damages (consequential losses): describe
   - Interest: claim pre-judgment interest (statutory or contractual rate)
   - Costs: include a claim for costs

8. **Prayer for relief**
   - Enumerate every remedy sought:
     - Judgment for damages in the principal amount of USD X
     - Pre-judgment interest
     - Post-judgment interest
     - Specific performance / injunction (where applicable)
     - Costs and legal fees
     - Such further relief as the Court deems just

9. **Verification** (where required by local rules)
   - Plaintiff's officer certifies accuracy of the pleading

## Civil-law style statement of claim (LB / KSA / UAE onshore / FR / EG)

### Structure

3. **Identification of Defendant(s)**
   - Full name(s) and address(es) for service

4. **Statement of facts** (narrative form)
   - Continuous chronological narrative (not numbered paragraphs — though some courts accept numbering)
   - Detail the relationship, the events, and the breach or harm
   - Cite relevant documentary evidence (attached as exhibits) throughout

5. **Legal arguments** (article-by-article)
   - In civil-law courts, the legal argument is part of the pleading, not reserved for trial
   - Cite: applicable statute, article number, court interpretation if established
   - Apply the article to the facts

7. **Annexed exhibits list**
   - Each exhibit identified by number, description, and relevance

8. **Signature block**
   - Plaintiff / counsel signature, date, place

## Critical procedural considerations

### Statute of limitations
Verify before filing — missing the limitation period is fatal:
- **UAE federal (commercial)**: generally 10 years (Civil Code Art. 473); some specific claims shorter (insurance: 3 years; checks: 6 months from dishonor)
- **KSA**: 5-year limitation for commercial claims under the Commercial Court Law; 1-year for some labor claims
- **LB**: 10 years for personal obligations (Code of Obligations Art. 340); shorter for specific categories (insurance, labor)
- **DIFC**: DIFC Law of Limitation — 6 years for contract; 6 years for tort (generally)
- **UK**: Limitation Act 1980 — 6 years for contract and tort; 12 years for deed
- **FR**: Code Civil Art. 2224 — 5 years from date knowledge of facts

### Jurisdiction (MENA specifics)
- **UAE federal courts**: commercial courts in Abu Dhabi and Dubai for commercial disputes; civil courts for non-commercial; ADGM and DIFC have exclusive jurisdiction over matters with a DIFC/ADGM nexus
- **KSA**: Commercial Court Law 2021 — dedicated commercial courts for commercial disputes; Labor Courts for employment; Administrative Courts for disputes with government entities
- **Lebanon**: Court of First Instance (civil/commercial); specialized courts (rent, labor); Court of Appeal for enforcement of foreign judgments
- **DIFC Courts**: opt-in for non-DIFC-nexus parties possible under a 2011 protocol (UAE parties may voluntarily submit)

### Service of process
- **MENA civil-law courts**: service by court bailiff (muhdar) is standard; personal service to defendant required in most cases; substituted service only if Defendant cannot be found after diligence
- **International service**: Hague Service Convention governs where both countries are members; diplomatic channels otherwise; UAE has bilateral service treaties with certain countries
- **DIFC/ADGM**: service in accordance with DIFC Courts Rules; may serve by email if contractually agreed

### Arabic language requirements
- **UAE federal courts**: all pleadings must be in Arabic; certified Arabic translations of any foreign-language documents are required
- **KSA courts**: Arabic required; foreign-language documents require licensed translator
- **LB**: Arabic or French accepted in most cases; Arabic required before certain courts
- **DIFC/ADGM**: English proceedings; Arabic translation not required for court filings

### Court fees
- **UAE federal courts**: typically 6% of the claim amount, capped at AED 40,000 per level; fees for interim relief additional
- **DIFC Courts**: graduated fee schedule based on claim value; DIFC Courts online fee calculator
- **KSA Commercial Courts**: court filing fee per schedule of fees under Commercial Court Law
- **LB**: modest court fees (legacy); additional lawyer registration fees
- Always verify current fee schedules — these change

## Drafting tactics

- **Lead with your strongest cause of action** — courts (and their clerks) read the first count first
- **Plead facts with specificity**: date, who did what, what document was involved — vague pleadings invite motions to dismiss / exceptions de procédure
- **Quantify damages early** even if the final number is "to be assessed at trial, but no less than USD X" — it alerts the court to the scale of the dispute and affects court allocation
- **Reserve the right to amend** — "Plaintiff reserves the right to add parties, claims, or causes of action pending further investigation and discovery / disclosure"
- **Attach key documents as exhibits** and refer to them in the body of the complaint
- **Do not volunteer weaknesses** in the complaint; but do not misrepresent — bad faith pleading carries sanctions in most jurisdictions

## Common mistakes

- Filing in the wrong court (wrong jurisdiction, wrong chamber) — requires refiling and potentially resets statute of limitations if the original was invalid
- Missing the limitation period
- Failing to serve Defendants properly — jurisdiction not established
- Omitting a cause of action that could have been pleaded — claim preclusion (res judicata) bars it later
- Pleading facts that are inconsistent with documentary evidence already in hand — credibility destroyed at an early stage
- Forgetting to request interim relief (injunctions, attachments) at the same time as the main claim, when urgency exists
