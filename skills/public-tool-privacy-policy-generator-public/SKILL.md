# Privacy Policy Generator (Public Tool)

## What it does

The Privacy Policy Generator produces a compliant, jurisdiction-specific privacy policy (and related documents) through a guided form. Rather than a generic one-size-fits-all template, it generates policies calibrated to the specific data types collected, processing purposes, recipient categories, and applicable regulatory framework(s) the user selects.

A privacy policy is mandatory under virtually every major data protection law. For businesses operating in MENA, the introduction of the KSA Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL, 2021), UAE PDPL (2021), and Egypt PDPL (2020) has made this a pressing compliance requirement — and the MENA-specific requirements differ materially from GDPR.

## Jurisdiction-specific policy content

### KSA PDPL requirements

The KSA PDPL (Royal Decree M/19/2021 and implementing regulations 2023) requires the privacy policy to disclose:
- Categories of personal data collected and purposes

- Data subject rights: access, correction, deletion, objection, withdrawal of consent
- Cross-border transfer mechanisms (SDAIA-approved)
- Contact details for the Data Protection Officer (if applicable)

- Specific consent mechanism requirements for special-category data
- Cross-border transfer: TDRA-approved countries or approved transfer mechanisms
- Arabic version required for UAE-facing consumer policies

- Lawful basis must be specified per processing activity

## Behavior rules

- **Do not generate policies for illegal data collection.** If the user selects processing purposes that suggest unlawful activity (e.g., covert surveillance, selling data to unauthorized third parties), decline and explain.
- **Special-category data triggers enhanced disclosures.** If health, biometric, financial, or children's data is selected, the generated policy must explicitly address the heightened legal basis required (explicit consent or legal obligation) and the additional protections applied.
- **Children's data.** If children's data is selected, generate parental consent mechanism requirements and age verification language appropriate to the jurisdiction.
- **AI training disclosure.** If "machine learning / AI training" is selected as a purpose, flag that several jurisdictions (EU, UK, KSA) require explicit, granular consent for AI training purposes that goes beyond a general "product improvement" clause.
- **Always include a disclaimer.** *"This privacy policy was generated by Louis as a starting point. It is not a substitute for legal advice. For businesses handling sensitive data or operating in regulated sectors, have this policy reviewed by a qualified data protection lawyer."*

## Failure modes

| Failure mode | Response |
|---|---|
| User selects conflicting jurisdiction requirements | Flag the conflict and generate the most restrictive version (e.g., if both GDPR and CCPA are selected, default to GDPR standards plus CCPA-specific addendum) |
| User's data collection is unclear or inconsistent | Flag inconsistencies; prompt user to review selections before generating |
| User requests a policy for a sector with additional regulatory requirements (healthcare, financial services) | Generate the base PDPL policy and flag: "Your sector may require additional privacy disclosures under [sector-specific regulation]. Have this policy reviewed by sector counsel." |
