# Cross-Border Data Transfer Assessment

Cross-border data transfers are one of the highest-risk areas of data protection compliance: a transfer that violates the applicable restriction can result in enforcement action, fines, contractual disputes, and reputational damage. The assessment framework is complex because it depends on both the origin jurisdiction's rules and the destination jurisdiction's legal protections.

## When to use this

- A company is implementing a new SaaS tool, cloud service, or data processor headquartered outside the origin jurisdiction.
- A group of companies is centralising data processing (e.g., HR data) in a shared services centre in a different country.
- A company is moving its data infrastructure to a new cloud region.
- An M&A transaction involves combining data from entities in different jurisdictions.
- A regulator or DPA has raised concerns about the company's data transfer practices.
- The company is building a new product that processes data of users from multiple jurisdictions and the developer needs to understand transfer restrictions from the outset.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|---|---|---|
| Origin jurisdiction (where the data originates) | Determines the restriction framework (GDPR, UAE PDPL, KSA PDPL, DIFC DP Law, etc.) | Ask the user |
| Destination jurisdiction (where the data will be sent/processed) | Determines whether an adequacy decision or safeguard is needed | Ask the user |
| Categories of personal data to be transferred | Risk level varies by data type (health, financial, biometric data carry higher obligations) | Ask the user |
| Volume and frequency of transfers | Distinguishes occasional from systematic transfers (different risk profile) | Ask the user |
| Existing legal relationship (controller-processor or controller-controller) | Determines which safeguard mechanism is appropriate | Ask the user |
| Purpose of the transfer | Must be consistent with the original processing purpose | Ask the user |

## Optional inputs

- Names of specific service providers or data processors receiving the data.
- Whether the destination country has surveillance laws that could override contractual protections (Schrems II factor).
- Whether any data localisation requirement applies in the origin jurisdiction.
- Whether the company has existing Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in place.

## Assessment methodology

### Step 1 — Identify the origin jurisdiction's transfer restriction framework

| Origin jurisdiction | Transfer restriction framework |
|---|---|
| EU | GDPR Chapter V (Articles 44–49); transfer only to: (a) adequate countries, (b) countries with appropriate safeguards (SCCs, BCRs, approved codes of conduct), or (c) specific derogations (Art. 49) |
| UK | UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018; UK adequacy regulations; IDTA (International Data Transfer Agreement, the UK equivalent of EU SCCs) |
| UAE (onshore) | UAE PDPL Art. 22–27; transfer requires: (a) adequate country, or (b) recipient provides adequate protection, or (c) consent, or (d) specific exceptions |
| UAE (DIFC) | DIFC DP Law 2020 Art. 27; transfer only to countries with adequate DP framework or with appropriate safeguards (DIFC SCCs or equivalent); DIFC Adequacy Decisions issued by Commissioner |
| UAE (ADGM) | ADGM DP Regs 2021 Art. 22; equivalent to DIFC framework |
| KSA | Saudi PDPL Art. 29; transfer permitted if: (a) no threat to national security or vital interests, (b) recipient provides adequate protection; NDMO regulations specify mechanisms |
| Lebanon | No comprehensive data protection law in force as of 2026; draft law under consideration; GDPR alignment recommended for EU-connected businesses |
| Egypt | Egyptian Data Protection Law (Law No. 151 of 2020); transfer requires adequate destination or contractual safeguards; MCIT regulations govern specifics |
| Qatar (QFC) | QFC Data Protection Regulations (2021); similar to GDPR framework |

### Step 2 — Assess the destination jurisdiction

**Tier A — Adequate jurisdictions (no additional safeguards needed from an EU perspective):**
EU adequacy decisions cover: Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, UK (for EU), and Uruguay (as of 2026). Verify current list — adequacy decisions can be revoked (Safe Harbor was revoked; Privacy Shield was revoked; EU-US Data Privacy Framework is current but subject to legal challenge).

**Tier B — Jurisdictions requiring appropriate safeguards:**
Most MENA countries (UAE, KSA, LB, EG) are not on EU adequacy lists. Transfers to these jurisdictions from the EU require appropriate safeguards.

**Tier C — Restricted jurisdictions (data localisation or outbound transfer ban):**
Some jurisdictions prohibit or severely restrict outbound transfer: Russia (Federal Law on Personal Data requires localisation of Russian citizens' data), China (PIPL requires security assessment for large-scale transfers), and certain sector-specific rules in KSA (health, financial, and government data localisation).

### Step 3 — Select the appropriate safeguard mechanism

| Mechanism | Suitable for | Key requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) — 2021 version** | Controller-to-processor; controller-to-controller; processor-to-processor transfers from EU | Must use the correct module; execute with all relevant parties; conduct Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) if destination has surveillance laws |
| **UK IDTA** | Transfers from UK following Brexit | Separate from EU SCCs; must comply with UK ICO template |
| **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** | Intra-group transfers where the group is established in EU | Require approval by lead supervisory authority; extensive process; suitable only for large multinationals |
| **DIFC SCCs / ADGM SCCs** | Transfers from DIFC/ADGM to non-adequate countries | Separate from EU SCCs; issued by DIFC Commissioner / ADGM Commissioner |
| **Consent of the data subject** | Ad hoc, one-off transfers where a derogation applies | Must be explicit, informed, specific; not suitable for systematic transfers; cannot be used as the primary mechanism for ongoing transfers |
| **Contractual necessity** | Transfer necessary for contract with or in the interests of the data subject | Narrow; not suitable for B2B data transfers |
| **Approved code of conduct / certification** | Where the destination party adheres to an approved code | Limited availability currently; growing in use |

### Step 4 — Conduct a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)

Required under GDPR post-Schrems II (Data Protection Schrems II ruling, CJEU July 2020) when transferring to a country with surveillance or law enforcement access laws that could undermine the safeguards:

1. **Identify the laws and practices** of the destination country that may affect the safeguard: mass surveillance laws, government access to data, national security exemptions.
2. **Assess the practical impact:** Has there been documented government access to data of the type being transferred? Are there oversight mechanisms and remedies for data subjects?
3. **Determine whether supplementary measures are needed:** Encryption (so government access yields only ciphertext), pseudonymisation, contractual prohibitions on disclosing data to authorities (with notification obligation), or technical measures.
4. **Document the assessment:** The TIA is a legal document that may be required by the supervisory authority. Keep it on file.

### Step 5 — Implement and document

- Execute the appropriate SCCs or other safeguard documents.
- Update the company's data processing register to record the transfer.
- Include the transfer description and safeguard in the Privacy Policy.
- Implement any supplementary technical measures identified in the TIA.
- Establish monitoring: if the destination jurisdiction changes its surveillance laws or an adequacy decision is revoked, the safeguard must be reassessed.

## Jurisdiction-specific traps

| Scenario | Trap |
|---|---|
| UAE company sending employee data to EU parent | UAE PDPL transfer restrictions apply outbound even though GDPR applies inbound; need to assess both regimes |
| KSA health data leaving KSA | Saudi NDMO health data regulations may require localisation or Ministry of Health approval |
| Dubai (non-DIFC) company receiving EU data | UAE PDPL (not DIFC DP Law) applies; DIFC SCCs are not the correct instrument |
| DIFC company sending data to non-DIFC UAE entity | Cross-DIFC-boundary transfer; DIFC DP Law Art. 27 applies |
| Group using US-based SaaS tool (e.g., Salesforce, Workday) | EU SCCs (Module 2) required; TIA required; EU-US DPF may cover if provider is certified |

## Output format

Deliver a Transfer Assessment Report:
1. **Summary:** Origin, destination, data categories, proposed safeguard, conclusion (transfer lawful / conditional / not recommended).
2. **Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)** (if destination has surveillance risk).
3. **Safeguard documentation checklist:** SCCs to execute, parties, modules, annexes required.
4. **Open issues / escalation points.**
