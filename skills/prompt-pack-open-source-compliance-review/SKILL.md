# Open Source Compliance Review

## When to use this

Use this skill when a company needs to identify and assess its open source software (OSS) obligations before a commercial product launch, M&A transaction, or regulatory audit. Open source licence compliance failures can result in mandatory source code disclosure, loss of IP protection, and litigation risk.

Triggers:
- "We're about to sell our SaaS product — does our use of open source create any disclosure obligations?"
- "The investor wants an OSS compliance review as part of IP due diligence."
- "Our engineering team used GPL libraries — what does that mean for our proprietary code?"
- "Conduct an open source compliance review of our software product."

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Product / codebase description | Scopes the review | Ask user |
| Component inventory (if available) | List of libraries, frameworks, dependencies | Ask user — if unavailable, recommend tooling |
| Distribution method | Distributed as binary / SaaS / embedded in hardware / open source | Determines which licence obligations are triggered |
| Licensing intent for the product | Proprietary / commercial / open source release | Ask user |

## Optional inputs

- Bill of Materials (SBOM) if generated
- Whether the review is for M&A due diligence or internal compliance
- Prior OSS compliance reviews
- Jurisdiction of primary market (affects software patent risk analysis for patent claims in OSS licences)

## Step 1: Component Inventory

If the company does not have an SBOM, recommend using automated tooling before conducting the legal review:
- **FOSS scanning tools**: Black Duck, FOSSA, WhiteSource/Mend, Scancode, OSS Review Toolkit (ORT)
- **Package manager analysis**: review `package.json` (npm), `pom.xml` (Maven), `requirements.txt` (pip), `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` as applicable
- **Binary analysis**: for compiled code where source is not available

The inventory should capture for each component:
- Component name and version
- Source / repository
- Declared licence (from package metadata)
- Actual licence (from source code headers — may differ from declared licence)
- How it is used: modified / unmodified; statically linked / dynamically linked / SaaS usage / loosely coupled

## Step 2: Licence Classification

Classify each component's licence into one of three risk tiers:

### Tier 1 — Permissive Licences (Low risk)
These licences permit use in proprietary software with minimal obligations (attribution, copyright notice, no warranty disclaimer removal):
- **MIT License**: attribution required; no source disclosure; widely used
- **Apache License 2.0**: attribution required; NOTICE file required; includes patent grant; compatible with most licences
- **BSD 2-Clause / BSD 3-Clause**: attribution required; 3-clause adds no-endorsement provision
- **ISC License**: functionally equivalent to simplified BSD

**Risk**: Low. Attribution requirements must be met (include copyright notices and licence text in documentation or about screen). Apache 2.0 includes a patent grant that terminates if you initiate patent litigation — note this.

### Tier 2 — Weak Copyleft Licences (Medium risk)
These licences permit use in proprietary software but require modifications to the licensed component itself to be released under the same licence:
- **LGPL v2.1 / v3**: modifications to the LGPL library must be released; the proprietary application may use the library if it is dynamically linked; static linking creates stronger copyleft obligations
- **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**: file-level copyleft; modifications to MPL files must be MPL; proprietary code in separate files is not affected
- **Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)**: similar to MPL but with explicit patent grant

**Risk**: Medium. Dynamic linking generally avoids copyleft contamination of proprietary code under LGPL, but legal analysis of "combined work" is fact-specific. Static linking with LGPL components requires careful analysis.

### Tier 3 — Strong Copyleft Licences (High risk — requires careful analysis)
These licences require that any derivative work or combined work be released under the same open source licence:
- **GPL v2 / v3**: if GPL-licensed code is combined with proprietary code, the combined work may be required to be released under the GPL; GPL v3 adds anti-tivoization and patent provisions
- **AGPL v3 (Affero GPL)**: GPL v3 plus: if the software is used over a network (SaaS), users must be able to obtain the source code; most dangerous licence for SaaS companies
- **EUPL v1.2 (European Union Public Licence)**: copyleft; used by EU government open source; compatible with some but not all other licences

**Risk**: High. Use of GPL or AGPL components in commercial software requires either:
1. Releasing the combined work as GPL/AGPL (open sourcing the product), or
2. Obtaining a commercial licence from the rights holder (dual-licenced open source), or
3. Removing or replacing the GPL/AGPL component

### Tier 4 — Non-Commercial Licences (Prohibit commercial use)
- Creative Commons **NC** variants: prohibit commercial use; not suitable for any commercial product
- **JSON License**: "shall be used for good, not evil" — famously declined by some corporates; legal enforceability disputed
- Various "source available" licences that are not true OSS

## Step 3: Compatibility Analysis

| Combination | Compatible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MIT + Apache 2.0 | Yes | Both permissive |
| MIT + GPL v2 | Only if overall work released as GPL | MIT code can go into a GPL project |
| Apache 2.0 + GPL v2 | Incompatible (FSF view) | Apache 2.0's patent termination clause incompatible with GPL v2 |
| Apache 2.0 + GPL v3 | Compatible | GPL v3 includes Apache-compatible patent provisions |
| LGPL + proprietary (dynamic link) | Generally yes | Legal analysis required |
| AGPL + proprietary SaaS | Generally no | SaaS distribution triggers source disclosure |
| GPL v2 + GPL v3 | Incompatible | Unless "v2 or later" wording permits upgrade |

## Step 4: Obligations Inventory

For each component by licence tier, list the obligations that must be met:

| Component | Licence | Obligation | Status | Action required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Library X] | MIT | Attribution in docs / about screen | Outstanding | Add copyright notice |
| [Library Y] | Apache 2.0 | NOTICE file inclusion | Completed | Verify in build |
| [Library Z] | LGPL v3 | Dynamic linking confirmed; modification source available | Under review | Confirm linkage method |
| [Library W] | GPL v3 | Combined work analysis required | Risk identified | Seek commercial licence or replace |

## Step 5: Remediation Recommendations

| Risk level | Finding | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | AGPL component used in SaaS product | Immediately assess whether source disclosure is required; seek commercial licence from maintainer; or replace with permissive alternative |
| **High** | GPL v2/v3 component statically linked with proprietary code | Legal opinion on "combined work"; obtain commercial licence or replace component |
| **Medium** | LGPL component statically linked | Confirm dynamic linking is feasible; if not, obtain LGPL exception or replace |
| **Low** | MIT / Apache 2.0 attribution notices missing | Add copyright and licence notices to product documentation, about screen, or NOTICES file |

## Step 6: Compliance Documentation

Best-practice OSS compliance documentation:
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: machine-readable inventory of all components and licences (CycloneDX or SPDX format)
- **NOTICES / THIRD-PARTY LICENSES file**: included in product distribution; lists all OSS components, versions, and licence texts
- **Copyright attribution**: display in product about screen, documentation, or packaging
- **Written Offer**: for GPL v2 / v3 if binaries are distributed, include a written offer to provide source code for 3 years

## M&A due diligence note

For M&A transactions, OSS compliance issues can affect deal value:
- Critical findings (AGPL in SaaS, GPL contamination of proprietary product) are material and must be disclosed or remediated pre-closing
- Include an OSS compliance representation in the SPA / representations and warranties
- Consider requesting an updated SBOM with clean compliance certification as a condition to closing

See [[prompt-pack-ip-due-diligence-checklist]] for the broader IP due diligence framework.

## Common mistakes

- **Not distinguishing SaaS from distribution**: distribution of binaries triggers GPL/LGPL obligations; pure SaaS (no binary distribution to users) does not trigger GPL/LGPL, but does trigger AGPL.
- **Assuming all MIT/BSD licences are identical**: check the specific version and text; there are non-standard variants that add restrictions.
- **Ignoring indirect (transitive) dependencies**: the direct dependency may be MIT but it may pull in a GPL transitive dependency; automated tooling is required to catch all transitive dependencies.
- **Missing patent grant implications**: Apache 2.0 grants a patent licence from contributors; GPL v3 terminates the patent licence if you initiate patent litigation against any contributor. These are material for patent-holding companies.
