# Connector — Legal Data Hunter

## What it does

Legal Data Hunter is HAQQ's proprietary internal service for acquiring, structuring, and surfacing legal data from MENA jurisdictions. It addresses the core gap in MENA legal research: the region's primary legal sources — statutes, decrees, regulations, ministerial decisions, court judgments — are often scattered across government portals, published only in Arabic or French, behind opaque websites with no structured API, or in scanned PDFs without machine-readable text.

The service combines:
- **Automated scraping** of government legal portals and official gazettes.
- **OCR and text extraction** for scanned Arabic and French legal documents.
- **Structured indexing** with consistent metadata (jurisdiction, source, date, category).
- **A queryable internal API** that the legal-AI platform calls when a request requires MENA-specific primary sources.

## Setup / auth

This is an **internal HAQQ API**:
- API endpoint: internal service mesh (not publicly accessible).
- Auth: per-tenant service token, issued by the platform operator.
- Rate limit: 200 requests/minute per tenant; enforced to protect the scraping infrastructure.
- No external API key management required by the end user.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Statute full-text retrieval | Retrieve full text of a law by name, number, or year |
| Ministerial decision lookup | Search by issuing ministry, subject, and date range |
| Official gazette search | Full-text search across indexed gazette issues |
| Judgment retrieval (where available) | Published court judgments by court and date |
| Arabic → English extraction | Returns Arabic text with an auto-translated English gloss (for orientation, not authoritative translation) |
| Amendment tracking | Where tracked, surface amendments to a base law |
| Regulatory timeline | Chronological list of enactments in a specific area of law |

## Usage patterns

### Pattern 1 — Lebanese commercial law provision

```
User: "What does Lebanese law say about the form requirements for a pledge of shares?"
→ Legal Data Hunter searches Lebanese Code of Commerce
→ Returns relevant provisions (in Arabic) with English gloss
→ Note: cite the official Arabic text; the English gloss is for orientation only
```

### Pattern 2 — UAE labor law update

```
User: "Has the MOHRE issued any new decisions on remote work since 2022?"
→ Searches MOHRE decisions index for date:after:2022 + keyword "remote"
→ Returns list of matching decisions with date and short description
→ Flags if OCR confidence on any document is below threshold
```

### Pattern 3 — KSA recent ZATCA change

```
User: "What are the current VAT rules for cross-border services into KSA?"
→ Searches ZATCA publications for VAT + cross-border services
→ Returns current regulatory text (KSA VAT rate: 15%)
→ Note effective date of the most recent amendment
```

### Pattern 4 — Egyptian investment law

```
User: "What incentives does Egypt's Investment Law offer to foreign investors?"
→ Searches Egyptian Official Gazette for Investment Law text
→ Returns full text with auto-translated English summary
```

## Accuracy and verification requirements

MENA primary legal sources retrieved by the Legal Data Hunter must be treated as **research starting points**, not final authoritative texts, because:

1. **Arabic legal Arabic is specialized.** OCR and machine translation of legal Arabic is imperfect. Always have a qualified Arabic-reading lawyer verify the operative provisions.
2. **Gazette issues are not always indexed in full.** Coverage gaps exist — particularly for older issues and for scanned-only documents.
3. **Amendment tracking is incomplete.** A law may have been amended by a subsequent decree that is not yet in the index. Always verify whether a retrieved text is the current in-force version.
4. **Free-zone law is partly internal.** DIFC and ADGM legislative drafts and amendments are covered; confidential DFSA/FSRA guidance and supervisory letters are not.

For any MENA legal matter where the outcome depends on a specific statutory provision, the practitioner must verify the text against the original Official Gazette issue.

## Permissions & safety

- **Internal API only.** The Legal Data Hunter is not a public connector; its endpoint and credentials must not be shared with end users or external parties.
- **Rate limiting.** Respect the 200 req/min limit. Long research queries should be queued, not burst.
- **Translation disclaimers.** All English translations returned by the service are machine-generated for orientation purposes. They must not be cited in legal documents or proceedings as authoritative translations — a certified sworn translator (مترجم محلف) is required for that.
- **No fabricated provisions.** If the service cannot find a provision, return "Not found in current index" — never synthesize or interpolate statutory text.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| "Not in index" | Source not yet scraped or OCR failed | Try [[connector-firecrawl]] directly on the source URL; flag for index expansion |
| Low OCR confidence | Scanned document with poor quality | Flag to user; provide raw image link for manual review |
| Arabic rendering issue | Text pipeline encoding error | Return raw UTF-8 Arabic string; let the UI handle rendering |
| Stale data | New decree not yet picked up by scraper | Note retrieval date; advise user to check source directly for recent weeks |
