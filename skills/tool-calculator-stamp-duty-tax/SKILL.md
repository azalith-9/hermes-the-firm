### KSA — Real Estate Transaction Tax (RETT)

- **Filing:** RETT declaration required with ZATCA (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority) before registration
- **Share transfers:** RETT does not apply to share transfers in a company owning real property; however, stamp duty / capital gains considerations may apply

---

### Lebanon — Registration and Stamp

- **Stamp duty:** 0.2–2% on top of registration

## Structuring notes

- **UAE:** Transfers via offshore corporate holding structures (BVI/Cayman) holding UAE freehold are common for high-value assets. Consult a UAE tax specialist on DLD treatment of corporate-layer transfers; DLD may treat the beneficial owner transfer as a triggering event.
- **KSA:** Share-for-property structuring to avoid RETT is closely watched by ZATCA; anti-avoidance provisions apply.
- **Lebanon:** Notarisation is mandatory and complex in the current financial environment; always involve a Lebanese notary.
- **UK:** SDLT anti-avoidance rules (FA 2003) and the sub-sale rules require specialist advice for complex structures.
