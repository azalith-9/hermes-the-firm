# Draft — Articles of Association

## When to use this

Use this skill to produce the constitutional document for a new company or to amend the constitutional document of an existing company. The Articles of Association (AoA) — variously called Memorandum and Articles (UK), Statuts (French/Lebanese), Nizam Asasi (Arabic) — is the primary governance document that:
- Creates the company.
- Defines the rights of shareholders.
- Governs the board and its powers.
- Controls how shares are issued and transferred.

In civil-law jurisdictions (Lebanon, KSA, UAE onshore), the AoA is a public document filed with the commercial registrar, typically notarized, and accessible to third parties. In common-law jurisdictions (DIFC, ADGM, UK), the memorandum and articles are filed with the registry.

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE (Federal Decree-Law 32/2021 on Commercial Companies)
- **LLC**: minimum 1 shareholder; maximum 50; no minimum capital (previously AED 150,000); no requirement for UAE national partner in most sectors (significant liberalization post-2020).
- **Mandatory statutory reserve**: 10% of annual net profit until reserve equals 50% of paid-up capital.
- **Objects clause**: can be broad; must not violate licensed activities.
- **Language**: Arabic AoA required for onshore LLCs; dual language (Arabic + English) common; Arabic controls.
- **Filing**: notarized and filed with the relevant DED (economic department) or free-zone authority.
- **PJSC** (public joint stock company): minimum 5 founders; minimum AED 30 million capital; more rigorous governance requirements.

### UAE Free Zones (DIFC / ADGM)
- English-language AoA.
- DIFC: DIFC Companies Law (DIFC Law 5/2018); DIFC Registrar of Companies.
- ADGM: ADGM Companies Regulations 2020; ADGM Registration Authority.
- Common-law principles govern interpretation; English-style articles acceptable.

### KSA (Companies Law — Royal Decree M/132 2022)
- **LLC**: minimum 1 shareholder; minimum capital SAR 500 for single-member, no minimum for multi-member (recent reform).
- **Arabic** is the required language; English translation for international parties.
- **Notarization**: AoA must be notarized and registered with Ministry of Commerce (Mawthq platform).
- **Sharia compliance**: objects clause must not include prohibited activities; certain financial structures require Islamic finance structuring.
- **Foreign ownership**: generally 100% foreign ownership now permitted in most sectors under Vision 2030 reforms; sector-specific restrictions remain.

### Lebanon (SAL — Société Anonyme Libanaise / SARL)
- **SAL**: minimum 3 founders for formation; minimum capital LBP (amount periodically updated; effectively modest in USD terms).
- **Statuts**: in Arabic and French (or Arabic alone); filed with the Commercial Register.
- **Notarization**: required for SAL formation; notary fees significant.
- **SARL** (limited liability): fewer formalities; single-member possible; maximum 20 members.
- **Mandatory legal reserve**: 10% of annual profits until reserve = 50% of capital.

### Egypt (Companies Law — Law 159/1981 and Investment Law 72/2017)
- SAE (Société Anonyme) and LLC (LLC under Law 159/1981).
- Minimum capital requirements vary by sector.
- Notarization and filing with GAFI (General Authority for Investment and Free Zones) or commercial register.
- Arabic required; English translation acceptable alongside.

## Objects clause — drafting note

**Broad objects clause** (preferred for most commercial companies): covers all lawful commercial activities; maximum flexibility. Common in common-law jurisdictions: "The Company may carry on any lawful business or activity."

**Narrow objects clause** (required in some regulated contexts or by local law): lists specific activities. Common in UAE/KSA where the license specifies the permitted activity and the AoA must mirror it.

**Risk of narrow objects**: any activity outside the stated objects is *ultra vires* — legally beyond the company's capacity. Err on the side of breadth.

## Common mistakes

- **Objects too narrow**: company outgrows its objects and cannot contract for new activities without an AoA amendment.
- **Missing pre-emption rights**: without them, a shareholder can transfer to any third party; important for closely-held companies.
- **No supermajority for material decisions**: if articles are silent, ordinary majority controls everything — including diluting minority shareholders.
- **Statutory reserve omitted**: mandatory in UAE, KSA, LB, EG; failure to include does not invalidate AoA but creates regulatory non-compliance.
- **Conflict between AoA and shareholders' agreement**: these must be read together; inconsistencies create legal uncertainty. Always review the SHA when drafting AoA.
