# Google Scholar Legal

## What it does

Google Scholar's legal database provides free, public access to:

- **US case law** — federal courts (SCOTUS, circuit courts, district courts) and all 50 state appellate courts
- **International case law** — selected Commonwealth jurisdictions, EU Court of Justice, and some civil-law court systems
- **Law review articles and legal journals** — full-text indexing of academic legal scholarship
- **Patent filings** — searchable through the same interface

Unlike Westlaw or LexisNexis, Google Scholar is rate-limited, has no citator service, and does not guarantee completeness. It is a strong cost-zero first pass and is the primary resource when a firm has no premium database subscription.

## Setup / auth

No API key required for public access. The tool issues HTTP requests to `scholar.google.com` with legal-specific query parameters.

**Rate limiting**: Google Scholar enforces aggressive rate limits. This tool:
- Rotates user-agent strings per request
- Implements exponential backoff on 429 / CAPTCHA responses
- Queues requests rather than parallelizing aggressively
- Informs the user if the rate limit has been hit and a delay is required

If CAPTCHA is encountered repeatedly, the tool falls back to a proxy pool or asks the user to complete a manual check.

## Capabilities

### Case law search
```
Input:  { query: "force majeure COVID-19 commercial lease", jurisdiction: "US" }
Output: [ { caseName, citation, court, year, snippet, url } ]
```

Supports:
- Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `-`)
- Phrase search (`"reasonable endeavors"`)
- Jurisdiction filter (US federal, by circuit, by state)
- Date range filter

### Article / law review search
```
Input:  { query: "MENA arbitration clause enforceability", type: "articles" }
Output: [ { title, authors, journal, year, citedByCount, url } ]
```

### Case fetch (full text)
```
Input:  { url: "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=..." }
Output: { fullText, court, date, citedCases: [...], citingCases: [...] }
```

Note: Google Scholar's "How cited" feature is not a citator — it shows co-citation but does not flag overruling or negative treatment. Always run through a real citator for authority verification.

## Usage patterns

**Pattern 1 — Quick precedent scan before premium research**
Run Google Scholar first to identify candidate cases, then run KeyCite or Shepard's on the top hits to confirm they remain good law.

**Pattern 2 — Academic commentary on emerging issues**
Search law review articles for analysis of novel legal questions (e.g., AI liability, crypto regulation) where practitioner databases may lag.

**Pattern 3 — International jurisdiction research**
For jurisdictions not covered by premium databases, Google Scholar often indexes high court decisions from Commonwealth countries and EU institutions.

**Pattern 4 — Budget-constrained users**
When the user confirms they do not have a premium subscription, default to Google Scholar + web search rather than returning an error.

## Permissions & safety

- Public web access only; no authentication stored.
- Do not cache full case texts beyond the current session — copyright considerations apply to commercial reproduction.
- Always label results as "Source: Google Scholar" so the user knows provenance.
- Flag that Google Scholar is **not exhaustive** for any jurisdiction: missing cases are a real risk, especially for older and lower-court decisions.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Rate limit / CAPTCHA | 429 or redirect to CAPTCHA | Backoff + retry; inform user |
| No results | Empty set | Broaden query; try alternate phrasing |
| Broken full-text link | 404 on case URL | Try court's official docket instead |
| Incomplete citation | Missing volume/page | Cross-check with official reporter |
| Jurisdiction gap | Non-US / non-Commonwealth courts poorly indexed | Use jurisdiction-specific tool (e.g., [[tool-legifrance-fr]] for France) |

## MENA considerations

Google Scholar's MENA coverage is limited. It does not index:
- GCC domestic court decisions (Saudi, UAE, Kuwaiti courts)
- Arabic-language court databases
- DIFC / ADGM judgments systematically (some appear but not reliably)

For MENA case law, use [[tool-lexisnexis]] (Lexis Middle East) or jurisdiction-specific tools. Google Scholar remains useful for international arbitration commentary (ICC, LCIA, DIAC) and comparative law articles relevant to MENA practice.

## Related skills

- [[tool-lexisnexis]] — preferred premium database with MENA coverage via Lexis Middle East
- [[tool-thomson-reuters-westlaw]] — preferred premium database for US/UK/AU
- [[tool-rag-public-legal-corpus]] — RAG over curated public court judgment corpora
- [[tool-web-search-orchestrator]] — broader web search including regulator sites
