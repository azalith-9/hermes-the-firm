# Related Party Transaction Policy

## When to use this

Use this skill when:
- A company is establishing or updating its corporate governance framework and needs a formal RPT policy.
- A listed or pre-IPO company requires an RPT policy that satisfies stock exchange listing rules (DFM, ADX, Tadawul, EGX).
- An institutional investor (PE fund, sovereign wealth fund, DFI) requires the portfolio company to adopt an RPT policy as a condition of investment.
- A board audit committee needs a policy to guide its review of management's related-party transaction disclosures.
- A company's auditors have flagged related-party transactions without adequate policy coverage.
- A company is undergoing M&A due diligence and needs to demonstrate governance controls.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| **Company name and entity type** | Policy must reference the specific company and its governing law | Ask before drafting |
| **Jurisdiction of incorporation** | Determines which legal definitions of "related party" apply and which mandatory disclosure rules govern | Ask; default to UAE onshore if unclear |
| **Ownership and group structure** | Determines who counts as a related party (shareholders above threshold, parent companies, sister entities) | Ask: "Who owns the company and is it part of a group?" |
| **Board and committee structure** | Determines which body approves which tier of transaction | Ask: does the company have an audit committee? |
| **Approval thresholds (if pre-determined)** | Allows customization; otherwise use market-standard thresholds | Default tiers: management approval below 1% of net assets; board approval 1–5%; shareholder approval above 5% |

## Optional inputs

- **Exchange listing rules applicable** — DFM, ADX, Tadawul, EGX each have specific RPT disclosure and approval obligations for listed companies.
- **Sector-specific rules** — banks (CBUAE requirements), insurance companies, investment funds each have sector-specific conflict-of-interest rules.
- **Existing conflict-of-interest policy** — the RPT policy may need to be consistent with or replace an existing CoI policy.

## Document structure

1. **Purpose and scope**
   - Why the policy exists: protecting minority shareholders, ensuring arm's length terms, meeting regulatory obligations.
   - Who it applies to: directors, senior management, controlling shareholders, and their affiliates.

2. **Definitions**
   - **Related party**: typically includes directors, key management personnel, controlling shareholders (usually defined as holding ≥10% or ≥20%), entities controlled by or controlling the above, immediate family members. The precise definition tracks the applicable accounting standard (IFRS IAS 24) and local company law.
   - **Related party transaction (RPT)**: transfer of resources, services, or obligations between the company and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.
   - **Material RPT**: any RPT above a defined threshold (see approval tiers below).

3. **Identification and disclosure of related parties**
   - Annual declaration process: all directors and senior management must submit an annual written declaration of their related-party interests.
   - Ongoing disclosure obligation: any new related-party relationship must be disclosed within [5/10/14] days of arising.
   - Register of related parties: maintained by company secretary; updated at each board meeting.

4. **Identification and disclosure of RPTs**
   - How to identify whether a proposed transaction involves a related party (screening against the register).
   - Advance disclosure to the board / audit committee before entering into any RPT.
   - Annual summary of RPTs to be included in the company's financial statements (IFRS IAS 24 requirement).

5. **Approval framework**

   | Transaction Value (as % of net assets) | Approval Required |
   |---|---|
   | Below 1% | CEO / Management approval; notification to board |
   | 1% – 5% | Audit Committee review and recommendation; Board approval |
   | Above 5% | Board approval; shareholder approval (ordinary or special resolution depending on jurisdiction) |
   | Any transaction where director has a direct financial interest | Board approval with interested director recusing; independent directors vote |

6. **Arm's length standard**
   - All RPTs must be concluded on terms no less favorable to the company than would be available in a transaction with an unrelated third party on equivalent terms.
   - For material RPTs, the board (or audit committee) should obtain an independent valuation or fairness opinion.
   - The basis for concluding the terms are arm's length must be documented.

7. **Interested party recusal**
   - Any director or senior manager who is a party to or has an interest in an RPT must:
     - Disclose the interest in full to the board before deliberation.
     - Recuse from voting on the transaction.
     - Leave the meeting during deliberation if requested.
   - Minutes must record the recusal and the basis for the board's determination that terms are arm's length.

8. **Prohibited transactions**
   - Loans to directors (prohibited or restricted under most MENA company laws).
   - Self-dealing contracts not approved under this policy.
   - Transactions designed to circumvent this policy by artificial structuring.

9. **Record-keeping and reporting**
   - All approved RPTs: documented in board minutes and company register.
   - Annual report / financial statements: summarize material RPTs per IFRS IAS 24.
   - Regulator reporting: as required by applicable exchange listing rules or sector regulator.

10. **Sanctions for non-compliance**
    - Failure to disclose a related-party interest is a breach of fiduciary duty.
    - Unapproved RPTs may be voidable at the company's election.
    - Directors in breach may be liable for damages and disqualification.

11. **Policy administration and review**
    - Owner: company secretary / general counsel.
    - Review frequency: annual, or whenever a material change in ownership or governance occurs.
    - Approval: board of directors.

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE — onshore (Federal Decree-Law No. 32 of 2021 on Commercial Companies)
- Art. 166+ governs conflicts of interest for LLC managers; Art. 166 requires disclosure and prohibition on voting.
- PSC/PJSC (public companies): SCA Governance Code requires detailed RPT disclosures in annual reports and advance board approval.
- Listed companies: DFM/ADX listing rules require immediate disclosure to the exchange of material RPTs.

### DIFC
- DIFC Companies Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2018): Companies Act-style duty of directors to avoid conflicts; related-party transactions require board approval with interested director recusal.
- Investment business: DFSA Rules impose additional conflict management requirements on regulated firms.

### KSA (Saudi Corporate Governance Regulations, CMA)
- CMA Corporate Governance Regulations require listed companies to have an RPT policy, audit committee oversight, and semi-annual disclosure of all RPTs.
- Any RPT with a controlling shareholder (holding ≥5%) of a listed company requires shareholder approval at general assembly.

### Egypt (EGX Listed Companies)
- FRA Corporate Governance Code requires listed companies to disclose RPTs in annual reports.
- Companies Law No. 159 of 1981 requires shareholder approval for transactions between the company and its directors.

### Lebanon
- Lebanese Commercial Code requires disclosure of director interests; prohibits self-dealing contracts without general assembly approval.
- Banking sector: BDL Circular 44 imposes strict related-party lending limits.

## Drafting standards

- Define "related party" with reference to IAS 24 (internationally recognized) and supplement with the specific local-law definition where they differ.
- Use a clear tiered approval table — this is the core operative provision that practitioners will apply.
- Include a worked example in an annex (e.g., "A director owns 20% of a supplier company; the company proposes to award the supplier a USD 500,000 contract; which approval level applies?").
- Avoid vague language like "significant transaction" — tie all thresholds to measurable financial metrics.

## Common mistakes

- **Using IFRS IAS 24 definition alone without checking local law.** Local company laws (UAE, KSA) may define related party more broadly or differently; the policy should capture both.
- **No recusal procedure for the CEO/MD.** Policies often cover directors but forget that the CEO is also an officer subject to conflict rules.
- **Threshold set too high.** A 10% of net-assets threshold for shareholder approval may miss many material transactions in a large company; calibrate thresholds to the company's actual transaction profile.
- **No standalone prohibition on director loans.** Failing to include this creates ambiguity — most MENA company laws prohibit or restrict loans to directors; state it explicitly.
