# Board Resolution Template

## When to use this

Use this skill when the user needs a **reusable, blank-form board resolution template** that can be adapted for any corporate action. This complements [[prompt-pack-board-resolution]] (which drafts a substantive resolution for a specific action). Use this skill when:
- Setting up a template for a law firm's or company's corporate secretarial library
- Creating a standard internal template for recurring corporate actions (e.g., monthly account authorizations, regular contract signings)
- Onboarding a client who needs a starting-point template to use repeatedly
- The user wants a clean structural form, not a completed resolution

---

## Prompt template

> Draft a board resolution for [approval of transaction/appointment/policy change]. Include recitals, resolved clauses, authorization details, and signature blocks per [jurisdiction] corporate law requirements.

Use [[conversation-clarifying-questions]] to elicit `[bracketed]` inputs — particularly the jurisdiction and the recurring action type.

---

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters |
|-------|---------------|
| Jurisdiction | Determines signature block format, quorum requirements, language requirements, notarization notes |
| Company type | LLC, PJSC, SAL, SARL, LTD — affects the form of resolution |
| Action category | Contracts, appointments, financial, governance — sets which resolved clause blocks to include |
| Signatory approach | One director / two directors / all directors (depends on articles and action type) |

## Master template

The following is the full master template. Customize per the action and jurisdiction. Replace all `[BRACKETED]` fields before use.

## How to adapt the template

### Action-specific customization
| Action | Key resolved clause content | Special notes |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Contract signing | Approval of specific agreement; authority to execute | Attach the agreement as an exhibit |
| Officer appointment | Name, ID, title, scope of authority | Specify limits on authority; register with relevant authority |
| Dividend | Amount per share, record date, payment date | Confirm distributable profits in recital |
| Share issuance | Number, class, price, allottee | Confirm pre-emption rights waived or not applicable |
| Bank account | Bank name, branch, signatories, signing limits | Banks often require their own form — attach this resolution to the bank's form |
| Budget/capex approval | Description of budget/project, amount, approving officer | Set threshold above which further board approval is required |
| Related-party transaction | Full description of transaction and party relationship | Additional approval process per corporate governance code |

### Jurisdiction-specific notes

**UAE (onshore — Ministry of Economy or free zone)**
- Resolutions submitted to government authorities must be in Arabic or with a certified Arabic translation
- Notarization: required for real estate transactions, court submissions, and some government filings; UAE Notary Public or DIFC/ADGM Notary
- DIFC and ADGM: resolutions in English are accepted; DIFC Companies Registrar filings use English forms
- LLCs: resolutions are often called "manager's resolutions" not board resolutions (in single-manager LLCs)

**KSA**
- All resolutions must be in Arabic
- Ministry of Justice notarization required for many submissions
- Closed joint-stock companies: board quorum and majority requirements in the Companies Law (Royal Decree M/3/2022 new Companies Law)

**Lebanon**
- Resolutions in French or Arabic (both official); Arabic required for government submissions
- Official company stamp (cachet) often expected by Lebanese authorities and banks
- SAL board: quorum and majority per the Commercial Code (Code de commerce du Liban)

**Egypt**
- Arabic required; Ministry of Justice notarization for real estate and government submissions
- Companies Law 159/1981: joint stock company board procedures

## Common mistakes

- Recitals not aligned with the company's actual articles — check the articles before using any standard form
- Authorization clause too broad ("do everything necessary") — specify what the authorized person can actually do
- No exhibit attached when the resolution refers to one
- Template used without updating the company type, jurisdiction, and officer names
- Written resolution used in a jurisdiction where the articles do not permit it — check the articles first
