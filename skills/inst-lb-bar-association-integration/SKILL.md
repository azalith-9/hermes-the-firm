# Inst — Lebanese Bar Association Integration

## Purpose

Lebanon has two bar associations: the **Beirut Bar Association** (BBA, Niqabat Muhami Beirut) covering Mount Lebanon and Beirut, and the **Tripoli Bar Association** covering North Lebanon and the Bekaa. Both are mandatory professional bodies for licensed Lebanese lawyers. This skill manages the institutional relationship between Louis/HAQQ and these bars — member verification, CLE tracking, legal aid routing, and the HAQQ Pioneers co-branding program.

---

## When to use this

- A user identifies as a Lebanese lawyer and requests bar card verification or CLE credit lookup
- A client needs referral to a bar-sponsored legal aid clinic in Lebanon
- A user asks about bar membership fees, renewal, or disciplinary procedures in Lebanon
- HAQQ partnership features are active: Pioneers discount codes, bar-co-branded webinars, advisory committee scheduling
- A matter requires confirming opposing counsel is in good standing with the BBA or TBA
- User asks about the HAQQ Pioneers program benefits for Lebanese lawyers

## Lebanese bar structure

| Bar | Geographic scope | President elected by | Members (approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beirut Bar Association | Beirut + Mount Lebanon + South + Nabatiyeh | General assembly | ~22,000 |
| Tripoli Bar Association | North Lebanon + Akkar + Bekaa + Baalbek-Hermel | General assembly | ~8,000 |

Both bars operate under **Decree-Law No. 3855 of 1960** (Lawyers' Statute) as amended. A lawyer must be a member of the bar in the region where they are domiciled.

---

## Member verification

Input: lawyer name (Arabic or French transliteration) + bar number or national ID  
Output:
- Registration status: active / suspended / struck off
- Bar branch (Beirut / Tripoli)
- Registration date + seniority tier (trainee / muawin / mohami)
- Disciplinary flag (if any public record exists)

Note: The BBA's digital directory is partially online; for definitive verification, the API queries the bar's member portal or advises the user to call the bar secretariat directly.

---

## CLE tracking

Lebanese bar regulations require periodic continuing legal education for license renewal (requirements vary by council cycle):
- Log CLE activities attended (seminars, webinars, court conferences)
- Map HAQQ/Louis-hosted webinars to approved CLE credit categories
- Alert lawyers approaching renewal deadlines
- Generate CLE transcript for submission to bar

**HAQQ-specific**: Louis usage sessions that include structured legal research, skill activations, or completed courses can be submitted for CLE credit under the bar's technology-education category (subject to bar council approval per cycle).

---

## Legal aid clinics

The Beirut Bar operates **legal aid committees** (Lajan al-Musa3ada al-Qadaiya) that provide free representation to:
- Persons below income threshold (set annually by bar council)
- Detained persons without counsel
- Domestic violence and trafficking victims
- Refugees (coordination with UNHCR and bar's Refugee Committee)

Routing logic:
1. Confirm user is in Lebanon and matter qualifies for legal aid
2. Identify nearest bar office (Beirut center / regional branch)
3. Provide intake process: application form, income declaration, required documents
4. For refugees: route to bar's dedicated refugee committee or UNHCR Lebanon partner organizations

---

## HAQQ Pioneers program

The Pioneers program is HAQQ's institutional partnership with the Lebanese bars:

| Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|
| Member discount | Verified BBA/TBA members receive discounted Louis subscription (code generated per member ID) |
| Co-hosted webinars | HAQQ + bar joint CLE events; recorded + archived on Louis |
| Lawyer-of-the-month | Bar nominates exceptional practitioners; featured in Louis newsletter + social |
| Bar advisory committee | Selected bar council members advise HAQQ product team quarterly |
| Priority access | BBA/TBA verified members get early access to new Louis features |

Verification flow: user enters bar number → system confirms with BBA/TBA directory → issues Pioneers discount code for Louis subscription → CLE credit logged.

---

## Institutional partnership rationale

Lebanon's legal profession faces severe headwinds post-2019: currency collapse, brain drain, reduced firm capacity. The BBA and HAQQ partnership:
- **Legitimacy signal**: bar endorsement differentiates Louis from generic AI tools in the eyes of Lebanese practitioners
- **Distribution**: 22,000+ BBA members are a significant adoption channel
- **Public access**: legal aid routing via bar clinics extends Louis's A2J mission to Lebanon's underserved population
- **Arabic + French**: Lebanese practice is bilingual — Louis's dual-language output is a key differentiator

---

## Practical notes

- The BBA's IT systems are aging; real-time API queries may not be available — provide manual fallback instructions when automated lookup fails
- Lebanese currency instability means pricing for Pioneers discounts must be quoted in USD (standard for Lebanese professional services)
- Bar council elections occur every two years; institutional contacts must be refreshed post-election
- The Tripoli Bar has a separate membership system — do not conflate BBA and TBA member numbers
