# Regulatory — Daily Digest Publisher

## Purpose

Regulatory change in MENA is constant and fast-moving. A daily digest ensures that legal teams, compliance officers, and clients stay current without spending hours monitoring multiple official publications. This workflow aggregates, filters, summarizes, and delivers a curated daily digest at 8am on every weekday — covering the key MENA regulatory bodies plus international developments that affect the firm's client base.

## Inputs / Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Jurisdictions covered | UAE, KSA, LB, EG, DIFC, ADGM, GCC | Add EU, UK, US, or others |
| Regulatory domains | AML/CFT, financial services, data protection, corporate, employment, tax | Narrow or expand per firm practice areas |
| Delivery channels | Email + Slack | Configure recipient list and Slack channel |
| Delivery time | 8:00 AM local (Asia/Beirut default) | Configurable by recipient timezone |
| Language | English summary; Arabic original reference | Add French for Lebanon-specific content |
| Digest frequency | Weekdays only | Can be set to 7 days during high-flux periods |
| Client distribution | Firm-internal by default | Enable opt-in external client distribution |

## Source Monitoring

The following sources are monitored daily:

### UAE

- SDAIA / NDMO — data protection regulations and guidance
- CMA (Capital Market Authority) — securities and capital market rules
- ZATCA (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority) — tax and customs regulations
- MISA (Ministry of Investment) — foreign investment regulations

### Lebanon
- Lebanese Official Gazette (Al-Jarida Al-Rasmiya) — laws and decrees
- BDL (Banque du Liban) — circulars and basic decisions
- Higher Banking Commission decisions (when published)

### Egypt
- Egyptian Official Gazette (Al-Jarida Al-Rasmiya) — laws and ministerial decisions

### GCC / Regional
- GCC Secretariat — unified standards and protocols
- Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) — regional AML/CFT guidance
- FATF — mutual evaluation reports, guidance notes (especially when MENA countries are assessed)

## Processing Pipeline

### Step 1 — Content ingestion (automated, nightly)

- Crawl official gazette and regulator websites for new publications
- Parse Arabic-language publications (Arabic NLP required)
- Parse English-language publications
- Deduplicate against prior 7 days
- Flag items older than 24 hours that were not captured in prior editions

### Step 2 — Relevance scoring

For each new item, assign:
- **Domain tags** (AML, data protection, corporate, financial services, employment, etc.)
- **Jurisdiction** 
- **Urgency** (IMMEDIATE = compliance deadline within 30 days; HIGH = 31–90 days; ROUTINE = 90+ days or informational)
- **Firm practice area match** (which practice groups and client types are affected)

Filter out: procedural government notices, infrastructure spending announcements, non-regulatory administrative matters.

### Step 3 — Summarization

For each item that passes the relevance filter:

**Summary format:**
```
[JURISDICTION] — [REGULATORY BODY] — [DOMAIN]
[Urgency badge: IMMEDIATE / HIGH / ROUTINE]
[Headline: 1 sentence describing the development]
[Summary: 3–5 sentences — what changed, who is affected, key date]
[Source: link to official publication]
```

Arabic-language items: provide Arabic original reference + English summary. Do not mistranslate — if uncertain, note "Arabic-language summary; verify against original."

### Step 4 — Assembly and formatting

Digest structure:

```markdown
# MENA Regulatory Digest — [Date]

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
[Items with compliance deadlines within 30 days]

## TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS

### UAE
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### KSA
- [Item 1]

### Lebanon
...

### Egypt
...

### GCC / Regional
...

## UPCOMING DEADLINES THIS WEEK
| Date | Jurisdiction | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| [date] | UAE | CBUAE Open Banking Phase 2 |

## ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS
[Any enforcement notices or published court/tribunal decisions with regulatory implications]

---
*Sources: [list of official publications checked]*
*Next digest: [tomorrow's date] at 8:00 AM*
```

### Step 5 — Delivery

- **Email**: HTML-formatted email to configured recipient list (firm distribution list + opted-in clients)
- **Slack**: summarized version in `#regulatory-digest` channel; IMMEDIATE items also posted to `#urgent-regulatory`
- **Firm portal** (if configured): posted to internal knowledge base
- **Archive**: stored with date stamp for future reference and contradiction checking

## Quality Controls

- If fewer than 3 items are identified on a given day, the digest still publishes with a note: "No new regulatory developments today that meet the relevance threshold."
- If a major development is identified (new law enacted, significant enforcement action), a supplementary alert is sent immediately outside the daily digest cycle — see [[pa-workflow-regulatory-client-alert-drafter-firm-voice]].
- Items are not published in the digest until source verification is complete — no social-media-sourced updates without official publication confirmation.

## MENA Publication Timing Notes

- UAE Official Gazette: published daily except Fridays; usually online within 24 hours of decree issuance
- CBUAE circulars: published directly on CBUAE website; no gazette requirement
- KSA Umm Al-Qura: published Fridays; SAMA circulars published directly
- Lebanese Official Gazette: published Mondays and Thursdays (historically); delays are common
- Egyptian Official Gazette: published daily; available online with some delay

Weekday-only delivery accounts for the Saturday–Sunday weekend in MENA. On Monday mornings, the digest includes Saturday + Sunday items.
