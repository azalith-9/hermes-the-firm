# Regulation Lookup

Retrieve the authoritative text of a specific statute, regulation, executive order, cabinet decision, or ministerial circular. Returns the full instrument with proper citation, effective date, and consolidation status (whether amendments have been incorporated). Covers MENA primary jurisdictions and secondary markets.

## When to use this

- A lawyer needs to quote the actual article text for a legal opinion, brief, or advice letter
- A compliance officer needs the primary regulatory text to anchor a compliance program
- A drafter needs to verify that a contractual clause accurately reflects the relevant statute
- A due-diligence team needs to confirm what law was in force at a specific historical date
- A researcher needs the full legislative instrument, not just a summary

**Note**: This skill retrieves text. For *interpretation* — what the regulator says the text means in practice — pair with [[research-regulator-guidance-lookup]]. For *changes* — whether the text has recently been amended — pair with [[research-recent-amendments-tracker]].

## Verbatim rule

**Always quote article text verbatim** — never paraphrase regulatory text. A paraphrase, however careful, risks omitting a condition or qualification that is legally material. If the text is in Arabic or French and an official English translation is not available, provide the original text plus a clearly labeled unofficial translation noting that the original controls.

## Caveats

- MENA databases frequently lag the official gazette by weeks or months for recent amendments. If the asOfDate on the retrieved text is more than 3 months old, run [[research-recent-amendments-tracker]] to check for updates.
- Many KSA regulations exist in Arabic only. Unofficial English translations circulate widely but may not accurately reflect recent amendments.
- Lebanon's online legal databases are fragmentary; for critical matters, request a certified extract from the official gazette or commercial register.
- US and EU sources are the most reliably current; verify eCFR consolidation date for very recent rulemakings.
