# Witness Statement (Arbitration)

## When to use this

Use this skill to draft a witness statement for international arbitration proceedings. International arbitration witness statements differ materially from court-filed statements in several respects:

- They are almost universally written in English regardless of the seat (DIFC, ICC, LCIA, SIAC, DIAC all conduct proceedings in English as the default language)
- They follow the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2020) as a widely accepted standard, even when not expressly adopted
- Exhibits are typically numbered as part of the claimant's or respondent's exhibit bundle (C-1, C-2... / R-1, R-2...) and the witness statement references them by exhibit number
- Witness statements substitute for oral direct examination; witnesses are presented for cross-examination only
- The tribunal may request a "hot tubbing" (concurrent expert or witness examination) format; this affects how the statement is structured

Use this skill for:
- Claimant or respondent witness statements in ICC, LCIA, DIAC, SIAC, ADCCAC, or ICSID arbitrations
- Investment arbitration witness statements (ICSID, UNCITRAL)
- Domestic arbitration where the parties have adopted international procedural rules (common in MENA commercial arbitrations)

For UAE onshore domestic arbitration under Law No. 6/2018 (Federal Arbitration Law), or KSA domestic arbitration under the Arbitration Law (Royal Decree M/34/2012), witness evidence procedures may be less formalized — adapt this structure accordingly.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Witness full name, title, and current employer / role | Identifies the witness and establishes basis of knowledge | Prompt user |
| Arbitration reference / case number | Identifies the proceedings | Prompt user |
| Arbitral institution and seat | Governs procedural rules and language | Prompt user |
| Applicable rules (IBA Rules, UNCITRAL, institutional rules) | Shapes structure and content requirements | Default: IBA Rules 2020 |
| Statement number (First, Second, Rebuttal) | Determines whether this is direct evidence or responding to opposing evidence | Prompt user |
| Factual matters to be covered | The substance | Prompt user — provide briefing notes or interview summary |

## Optional inputs

- **Procedural timetable / Procedural Order No. 1** — confirms page limits, exhibit rules, language requirements
- **Opposing witness statements / expert reports** — if this is a rebuttal statement, provide for targeted response
- **Tribunal's specific instructions** — some tribunals require specific formatting (Times New Roman 12pt; numbered paragraphs; etc.)
- **Confidentiality order** — if the arbitration is under a confidentiality regime, confirm whether the statement may reference documents marked confidential

## Document structure

### Header block
```
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION
[CASE REFERENCE]

In the matter of an arbitration under [ICC/LCIA/DIAC/SIAC/UNCITRAL] Rules
Between:
[CLAIMANT] — Claimant
and
[RESPONDENT] — Respondent

WITNESS STATEMENT OF [FULL NAME]
[First / Second / Rebuttal] Witness Statement
Dated: [DATE]
```

### 1. Introduction
- Full name, nationality, current position and employer
- Length of time in current role; relevant professional background (brief — 2–4 sentences)
- "I am authorized by [Party] to make this statement on its behalf" (if corporate witness)
- "The facts set out in this statement are within my personal knowledge, except where otherwise indicated"
- Reference to documents reviewed in preparation: "In preparing this statement I have reviewed [list or general description: e.g., the correspondence in my files and documents disclosed in these proceedings]"
- If any part is based on information from colleagues / third parties, identify the source and explain why the witness cannot personally confirm

### 2. Background
- Witness's role at the company and how it relates to the dispute
- The project / transaction / contractual relationship at issue
- How and when the witness became involved in the relevant events
- Keep to 2–5 paragraphs — detailed chronology belongs in §3

### 3. Factual narrative
- Chronological account of the events the witness directly participated in or observed
- Paragraph-level granularity: one event or topic per paragraph
- Reference exhibits by bundle number: "[Exhibit C-15]" or "[Exhibit R-3]"
- Where a meeting or call took place: state who was present, when, where (phone/in person), and what was said / agreed / decided
- Where the witness sent or received a document: reference it as an exhibit; do not merely paraphrase
- Where the witness is aware of events they did not directly observe: state clearly "I was informed by [Name] that..." and explain the source
- Avoid characterizing events as "consistent with" or "proof of" — factual description only

### 4. Response to opposing party's factual allegations (rebuttal statement only)
- If this is a rebuttal, address the specific paragraphs of the opposing witness statements that the witness disputes
- Cross-reference: "In [Name]'s First Witness Statement, paragraph [X], [Name] states [quote]. This is incorrect. [Witness's account]."
- Focus on matters within the witness's direct knowledge; do not speculate about the opposing witness's credibility or motivations

### 5. Statement of truth
The IBA Rules 2020 do not prescribe exact wording but the following is standard practice in international arbitration:

> "I, [FULL NAME], hereby certify that the facts stated in this witness statement are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief."

Some institutions or tribunals specify language; where a Procedural Order addresses the statement of truth, use that language verbatim.

If the witness is in a jurisdiction where a notarized affidavit is customary (e.g., KSA), confirm with the tribunal whether notarization is required or whether a signed statement is sufficient.

### 6. Signature block
- Date and place of signing
- Witness signature
- Full name printed below

## IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence — key provisions

| Article | Content | Practical note |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 4 | Witness statements — form and content | Must contain full name, address, employer, present-tense facts, references to documents, and statement of truth |
| Art. 4(5) | Simultaneous exchange vs. sequential | Many tribunals order simultaneous exchange of first witness statements; rebuttal statements follow |
| Art. 4(6) | Tribunal may limit number of witnesses | Tribunals sometimes cap witness statements at a page limit; check Procedural Order |
| Art. 4(7) | Request to appear for cross-examination | Either party may request that a witness appear; witness who does not appear may have their statement excluded or given no weight |
| Art. 4(8) | Witnesses not testifying at hearing | If a witness cannot attend, statement may still be admitted but will receive less weight |
| Art. 8 | Evidentiary hearing | Witness examination order; cross-examination follows direct; re-examination on new matters only |

## Jurisdictional notes

**DIAC (Dubai International Arbitration Centre):** DIAC Arbitration Rules 2022 apply by default; IBA Rules commonly adopted as guidance. Seat typically Dubai; English is predominant language; Arabic translation may be required for Arabic-speaking witnesses. Dubai Federal Courts (not DIFC) have supervisory jurisdiction over DIAC awards.

**DIFC-LCIA (now DIAC):** Following the merger of DIFC-LCIA into DIAC in 2021, new arbitrations are filed under DIAC Rules 2022. DIFC Courts have supervisory jurisdiction over arbitrations seated in the DIFC.

**ADCCAC (Abu Dhabi Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration Centre):** Now rebranded; ADCCAC Rules 2013 still referenced in older arbitration clauses; procedural rules similar to international norms; Abu Dhabi courts supervise.

**ICC:** Most common seat for major MENA commercial arbitrations; ICC Rules 2021; no specific witness statement requirements beyond Art. 25(3) (parties may submit written statements signed by witnesses); IBA Rules often adopted as supplement.

**LCIA:** LCIA Rules 2020 Art. 20; similar flexibility; witness statements common.

**Investment arbitration (ICSID):** ICSID Arbitration Rules 2022 Rule 36 — tribunal may request fact witnesses; no mandatory statement form; in practice, detailed written statements following international commercial practice are submitted.

**KSA domestic arbitration (Royal Decree M/34/2012):** Domestic arbitration law modernized and aligns broadly with UNCITRAL Model Law; witness evidence practice is developing; for international-standard MENA arbitrations, parties often elect DIAC or ICC rules regardless of seat.

## Drafting standards

- **Numbered paragraphs are mandatory** — arbitration witness statements must have consecutive paragraph numbers (¶1, ¶2, etc.) so that parties can cross-reference in skeleton arguments and the tribunal can refer to specific paragraphs in the award
- **Exhibit references must map to the exhibit bundle** — confirm exhibit numbers with the legal team before finalizing; a mismatch between statement references and exhibit bundle is a significant error
- **Avoid opinion and legal argument** — the tribunal knows the law; factual witnesses should not explain what an event "means legally"; reserve legal characterizations for briefs and memorials
- **Length discipline** — tribunals frequently set page or word limits; aim for concision; a long statement that does not add weight over a short one actively harms credibility
- **Witness review and sign-off is essential** — the statement is the witness's evidence, not the lawyer's; the witness must understand and genuinely adopt every paragraph before signing

## Common mistakes

- **Paragraphs that characterize documents** — "This email shows that..." is argument; the statement should describe what the witness saw, sent, or received, not what it proves
- **Hearsay not flagged** — in international arbitration, hearsay is generally admissible but should be identified; hidden hearsay undermines credibility
- **No exhibit numbers** — references to "the email of 15 March" without an exhibit number are ambiguous and difficult to trace in a large bundle
- **Missing statement of truth** — technically curable but creates procedural delays and may affect weight given to the statement
- **Not tailored to IBA Rules / institutional rules** — generic court-style witness statements may not comply with the procedural order; always check the tribunal's specific instructions
