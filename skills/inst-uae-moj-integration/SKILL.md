# Inst — UAE Ministry of Justice Integration

## Purpose

The UAE operates a dual court structure: **onshore UAE courts** applying UAE federal and emirate laws (civil law framework), and **offshore financial center courts** (DIFC Courts and ADGM Courts) applying English common law. This skill bridges Louis to both systems: federal MOJ services, emirate-level court portals, notarial services, and the electronic filing infrastructure across the UAE.

## When to use this

- A user has a matter before UAE courts — federal, emirate, DIFC, or ADGM
- A practitioner needs to file documents via UAE e-court systems
- A user requests UAE government legal document templates (PoA, court petitions, company resolutions)
- A foreign judgment needs to be enforced in the UAE
- A UAE document requires notarization or authentication for use abroad
- A user asks about court jurisdiction allocation in the UAE (which court hears what)

## UAE dual court structure

### Onshore UAE courts

| Court level | Jurisdiction | Electronic portal |
|---|---|---|
| Courts of First Instance | Original civil, commercial, personal status, criminal | Emirate-specific portals |
| Courts of Appeal | Appeals from Courts of First Instance | Emirate-specific portals |
| Federal Supreme Court | Final appeals; constitutional matters; disputes between emirates | Federal MOJ portal |

**Emirate-level portals:**
- **Dubai**: Smart Courts (Dubai Courts website + Dubai Courts app); integrated with UAE Pass
- **Abu Dhabi**: Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) e-portal; integrated with UAE Pass + Tamm
- **Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, etc.**: MOJ national e-court portal covers non-Dubai/AD emirates

### Offshore financial center courts

| Court | Governing law | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|
| DIFC Courts | English common law | DIFC-seated matters; parties may opt in by agreement (Art. 5 DIFC Courts Law) |
| ADGM Courts | English common law | ADGM-seated matters; opt-in available |

DIFC and ADGM courts have a **small claims tribunal** track (DIFC SCT: claims up to USD 200,000 / employment up to AED 500,000) with simplified procedure.

### Abu Dhabi (ADJD)
- ADJD Mahakim app + web portal
- Integrated with Tamm (Abu Dhabi government digital platform)
- Case filing, fee payment, judgment download
- Execution (enforcement) applications filed electronically

## Notarial services in UAE

| Service | Provider | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| General notarization | Federal MOJ notary offices + emirate courts | Walk-in; some online booking |
| Real estate PoA | Dubai Land Department or Abu Dhabi courts | DLD portal (for Dubai real estate) |
| DIFC Wills Service | DIFC Courts | Online registration for non-Muslim wills; enforceable within UAE |
| ADGM Wills | ADGM Courts | Equivalent service for Abu Dhabi-based non-Muslims |
| Company resolutions | Emirate-level courts + company authority | Notarization requirements vary by company type |

**Apostille**: Since 2021 UAE joined the Hague Convention — apostilled documents from member states accepted without embassy legalization. UAE-issued documents can receive apostille from the federal MOJ.

## Legal framework reference

| Instrument | Subject |
|---|---|
| Federal Law No. 11 of 1992 (Civil Procedure Law) | Onshore UAE courts procedure |
| Federal Decree-Law No. 32 of 2021 (Commercial Companies Law) | Company governance |
| Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 (Personal Data Protection Law) | Data privacy |
| Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021 (Labor Law) | Employment — Labour Court jurisdiction |
| DIFC Law No. 10 of 2004 (DIFC Courts Law, as amended) | DIFC Courts jurisdiction |
| Federal Law No. 6 of 2018 (Public Procurement) | Government contracting |
| UAE Arbitration Law (Federal Law No. 6 of 2018, amended 2019) | Arbitration — UNCITRAL based |

## Judgment enforcement

### UAE onshore judgments
- Apply to execution court (Mahakim al-Tanfidh) at emirate where defendant has assets
- Attach bank accounts, real estate, or salary (salary garnishment available in UAE)
- Foreign judgment enforcement: onshore courts enforce on reciprocity basis + treaty; process through Court of First Instance

### DIFC/ADGM judgments
- DIFC judgment → recognized within DIFC; enforcement onshore via DIFC-Dubai agreement (Protocol 2009) allows direct enforcement in Dubai Courts
- ADGM judgment → ADGM-Abu Dhabi enforcement protocol
- DIFC/ADGM judgments recognized in other common-law jurisdictions with fewer barriers than onshore UAE judgments

---

## Common mistakes

- **DIFC opt-in misuse**: parties cannot simply write "DIFC Courts" in a contract if neither party has DIFC nexus — jurisdiction requires DIFC connection or Article 5(A)(2) opt-in meeting requirements
- **Language**: onshore courts require Arabic pleadings; certified translation mandatory for exhibits in other languages
- **Notarial PoA for property**: DLD requires PoA notarized by Dubai Courts or attested by UAE Embassy abroad — not all notarizations accepted
- **Limitation periods**: UAE Civil Transactions Law sets 15-year general limitation; specific periods for commercial claims (10 years), labor claims (1 year)
