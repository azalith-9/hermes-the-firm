# Draft — Compliance Manual

## When to use this

Use this skill when a regulated business needs a comprehensive internal compliance manual — the master governance document that:
- Summarizes all applicable regulatory frameworks in one place.
- Assigns ownership and accountability for each compliance obligation.
- Consolidates policies (AML, sanctions, data privacy, conduct of business) by reference or in full.
- Provides the documented framework that regulators and auditors expect to review.

A compliance manual is distinct from individual policies (AML policy, privacy policy): it is the overarching document that explains *how* all the policies fit together and *who* is responsible for what.

- Customer file reviews (sample-based; frequency based on risk tier).
- Complaint monitoring.

**Compliance testing** (periodic, second-line):

- Reports to Board Audit Committee.
- Findings: management action plan required within 30 days of report issue.

**Regulatory inspections**:

### Chapter 7 — Reporting and escalation

**Internal escalation pathway**:
```
Staff → Line Manager → CO → CEO → Board Compliance Committee
```

**STR/SAR pathway**:
```
Staff → MLRO → External FIU filing
(never bypass the MLRO; never tip off the customer)
```

**Regulatory reporting**:
- Annual compliance report to Board: summary of compliance activities; issues identified; training completion; audit findings; regulatory developments.
- Periodic reports to management: monthly or quarterly compliance dashboard (incidents, open items, training status).
- Ad hoc reporting to regulator: material incidents, notifiable events, license condition breaches — report promptly; do not wait for the annual report cycle.

### Chapter 8 — Breach response and sanctions protocols

**Definition of a compliance breach**: any failure to comply with applicable law, regulation, regulatory rule, or this manual.

**Classification**:
- **Critical breach**: regulatory reporting required; immediate escalation to Board; potential criminal/regulatory liability.
- **Significant breach**: potential regulatory notification; escalation to CO and CEO; root-cause analysis.
- **Minor breach**: managed within the compliance function; documented; training response.

**Investigation procedure**:
1. CO receives notification (from staff, monitoring tool, or external source).
2. CO assesses materiality and classifies breach.
3. If Critical: notify Board and consider regulator notification within applicable timeframe.
4. Investigation: facts gathered, timeline established, root cause identified.
5. Remediation plan: control improvements, process changes, training.
6. Documentation: all steps logged; retained.

**Staff sanctions for willful non-compliance**:
- Minor: formal warning.
- Significant: written warning; training; supervisor notification.
- Serious / willful: disciplinary proceedings; potential termination; regulatory referral.

### Chapter 9 — Document control

| Attribute | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Version control | Every revision of this manual bears a version number and effective date |
| Approval | Board or Compliance Committee approval required for material amendments |
| Distribution | All staff must have access to the current version; superseded versions archived |
| Retention | Retained for at least 7 years after the effective date of the version |
| Language | Primary language: English; Arabic translation provided where required by regulation |

## Caveats and currency

Regulations change frequently. This manual must be reviewed:
- At least annually.
- Promptly upon any material change to applicable law or regulation.
- Upon any significant change to the business model.

A compliance manual that is out of date is worse than no manual — it creates false assurance. Assign ownership and a review calendar.
