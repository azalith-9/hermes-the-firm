# Employee Privacy Notice

## When to use this

Use this skill when a company needs to prepare or update its employee privacy notice — the transparency document that informs employees and job applicants about how their personal data is processed. Unlike a customer-facing privacy policy, the employee privacy notice covers workplace-specific processing activities: payroll, performance management, disciplinary records, monitoring, benefits administration, and more.

Typical triggers:
- Company entering a new jurisdiction where a data protection law applies
- Existing notice requires update following enactment of UAE PDPL, KSA PDPL, or other law
- HR system migration or new monitoring technology being introduced
- Data protection audit identifies a gap in employee notice documentation
- Employment contract or handbook update that should reference a revised privacy notice

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Employer name and jurisdiction(s) of operations | Identifies the data controller(s) and applicable law | Ask |
| Types of employees covered | Permanent, temporary, contractors, job applicants — each may be processed differently | Ask |
| HR systems and tools in use | Each system processes different categories of data | Ask |
| Monitoring activities in place | CCTV, email monitoring, location tracking, productivity software | Must be disclosed; ask |
| International transfers within the corporate group | Payroll, HR systems, and group reporting often cross borders | Ask |
| Applicable data protection law(s) | Determines legal basis requirements, rights, and mandatory disclosures | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Whether the employer uses automated decision-making (AI screening, performance algorithms)
- Specific sensitive data categories processed (health data, biometric data for access control, trade union membership)
- Retention schedule already established
- DPO or Data Privacy Officer appointment (required under GDPR for some employers)

## Document structure

### Section 1 — Who is responsible for your data?

Identify the data controller:
- Company legal name, registered address
- Contact details for privacy queries (Data Protection Officer if applicable)
- Where multiple group entities are involved, identify the primary controller and any joint controllers

### Section 2 — What personal data do we collect?

List the categories of personal data processed, organized by HR process:

**Recruitment and onboarding**:
- Identity information (full name, date of birth, nationality, passport / Emirates ID / Iqama number)
- Qualifications, CV, employment history, references
- Right to work documentation
- Background check results (criminal record, credit — where permitted by law)

**Employment administration**:

- Beneficiary designations; family details for health insurance
- Pension or DEWS (DIFC End of Service Scheme) records

**Special categories** (require explicit disclosure):
- Health data (medical certificates, disability accommodations)
- Biometric data (fingerprint or face recognition for access control)

### Section 3 — Why do we process your data and what is our legal basis?

For each processing activity, state: (a) the purpose and (b) the legal basis.

| Purpose | Legal basis (GDPR) | MENA equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Performing the employment contract (payroll, leave) | Contract performance | Contract performance (UAE PDPL Art.; KSA PDPL Art.) |
| Complying with legal obligations (NSSF, gratuity, tax) | Legal obligation | Legal obligation |
| Health and safety management | Legal obligation / vital interests | Legal obligation |
| Performance management | Legitimate interests | Legitimate interests (where recognized) |
| Workplace monitoring | Legitimate interests (with balancing test) | Subject to specific rules — see jurisdictional notes |
| Group reporting and consolidation | Legitimate interests | Legitimate interests |
| References for job applicants | Consent / legitimate interests | Consent |

### Section 4 — How long do we keep your data?

Provide a retention schedule by category:

| Data category | Retention period | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Payroll and compensation records | 7 years post-employment (typical minimum for tax purposes) | Legal obligation |
| Performance records | Duration of employment + 2 years | Legitimate interests |
| Health and safety records | Duration of employment + 10 years (or longer for occupational disease) | Legal obligation |
| CCTV footage | 30–90 days (unless relevant to an incident) | Proportionality |
| Recruitment records (unsuccessful candidates) | 6 months (EU); 1–2 years (MENA varies) | Legitimate interests |
| Disciplinary records | Spent after rehabilitation period | Legitimate interests |

### Section 5 — Who do we share your data with?

List categories of recipients:
- Group companies: for HR administration, payroll, reporting
- Third-party payroll providers; HR software vendors
- Health insurance providers; pension / DEWS administrators
- Government authorities: GOSI (KSA), GPSSA (UAE), MOHRE (UAE), tax authorities, NSSF (Lebanon)
- Law enforcement: if legally required
- Reference requests: from prospective employers (with employee consent or as permitted by law)

For international transfers, identify the mechanism: adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses, group BCRs.

### Section 6 — Your rights

List the rights available to employees under the applicable law:

**Under GDPR (EU / UK)**:
- Right of access (Art. 15) — receive a copy of personal data held
- Right to rectification (Art. 16) — correct inaccurate data
- Right to erasure (Art. 17) — in limited circumstances
- Right to restrict processing (Art. 18)
- Right to data portability (Art. 20) — for automated processing on consent/contract basis
- Right to object (Art. 21) — to legitimate-interests processing
- Rights regarding automated decision-making (Art. 22)

**Under UAE PDPL (Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021)**:
- Right to access, correct, and withdraw consent
- Right to request deletion (subject to retention obligations)
- Right to object to automated processing

**Under KSA PDPL (Royal Decree M/19 of 1443)**:
- Right to access, correct, and request deletion
- Right to withdraw consent
- Right to know third-party recipients

**How to exercise rights**: Provide contact details; state the [30]-day response timeline.

### Section 7 — Monitoring and surveillance

This section must be specific and transparent about each monitoring activity:
- CCTV: locations monitored; purpose (security only); access restrictions; footage retention
- Email / internet monitoring: scope; purpose; whether personal use is monitored; who has access
- Location tracking: whether and how devices or vehicles are tracked; purpose; employee notification
- AI / automated tools: performance monitoring software; productivity tracking

**MENA legal position on workplace monitoring**:
- **UAE**: No specific workplace monitoring law; monitoring must be proportionate and disclosed; PDPL principles apply to data collected
- **KSA**: Similar; PDPL requires consent or legitimate interest basis; monitoring of religious practice data is prohibited
- **DIFC**: DIFC Employment Law requires transparency; workers have right to know about monitoring
- **EU / UK**: Monitoring must be necessary, proportionate, and notified in advance; covert monitoring is unlawful in most circumstances (Article 8 ECHR); Works Council consultation required in many EU jurisdictions

### Section 8 — International transfers

Identify all cross-border data transfers:
- Name the receiving country and entity
- State the transfer mechanism: adequacy, SCCs, BCRs, or local equivalent
- UAE/KSA transfers to countries without adequate protection require contractual safeguards

### Section 9 — Changes to this notice

State that the notice may be updated; how employees will be notified of material changes.

### Section 10 — How to contact us / make a complaint

- Employer contact for privacy queries
- Regulatory authority where employees can complain:
  - UAE: UAE Data Office
  - KSA: Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA)
  - DIFC: DIFC Commissioner of Data Protection
  - EU: Relevant national supervisory authority (e.g., CNIL in France, ICO in UK)

## Jurisdictional notes

### Consent as a legal basis for employee data

In EU/UK GDPR, employee consent is generally **not** a reliable legal basis for employment data processing because of the power imbalance in the employment relationship — consent may not be freely given. Use contract performance or legal obligation for most HR processing; use legitimate interests (with a balancing test) for others.

In MENA jurisdictions (UAE PDPL, KSA PDPL), consent is more commonly used as a basis but is still subject to a genuine "voluntary" requirement. For routine HR processing, frame the basis as contractual necessity or legal obligation where possible.

### Biometric data

Biometric data (fingerprints, facial recognition, retina scans) is a sensitive data category in all modern data protection regimes. In the UAE, KSA, and EU:
- Processing requires explicit consent or a specific legal basis
- Proportionality is required: cannot use fingerprint access control if a PIN code would suffice for the same purpose
- Biometric data must be stored with enhanced security

### Right to work verification

In UAE and KSA, employers are required by law to collect, verify, and retain identity documents from all employees. This mandatory processing overrides consent requirements; disclose it under "legal obligation" basis.

## Common mistakes

- **Generic GDPR template applied to MENA employees**: GDPR does not automatically apply in UAE or KSA; the notice must reflect the applicable local law; applying incorrect rights (e.g., right to portability) where the law does not grant them confuses employees.
- **Omitting monitoring disclosures**: CCTV or email monitoring that is not disclosed in the notice may be unlawful; employees have successfully challenged disciplinary proceedings where monitoring was covert and undisclosed.
- **No retention schedule**: A notice that says "we keep your data for as long as necessary" without specifics does not satisfy transparency requirements under GDPR or PDPL.
- **Missing special category data disclosure**: If health data or biometric data is processed (health insurance, fingerprint attendance systems), this must be explicitly called out.
- **No Arabic version**: UAE and KSA employers should provide the notice in Arabic for local employees; some regulators may require the Arabic version to be the authoritative one.
