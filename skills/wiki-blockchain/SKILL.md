# Blockchain — Technology and Legal Framework

## Scope

This knowledge pack covers blockchain technology primitives and their legal implications, with particular focus on the MENA regulatory regimes that have emerged to govern virtual assets and smart contracts. It is written for legal professionals who need to advise on digital asset matters or understand the technical context of blockchain-related disputes and transactions.

## Core technical concepts

### Distributed ledger and consensus

A blockchain is a distributed ledger — a database replicated across many nodes (computers) with no single controlling authority. Transactions are grouped into blocks, cryptographically linked to the previous block (the "chain"), and replicated across all nodes.

Consensus mechanisms govern how nodes agree on which transactions are valid:
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: nodes compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle; the winner adds the next block. Bitcoin uses PoW. Energy-intensive.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: nodes are selected to validate blocks in proportion to their staked cryptocurrency. Ethereum moved to PoS in 2022 ("the Merge"). More energy-efficient.

The practical legal consequence: once a transaction is included in a sufficiently deep block, it is computationally impractical to reverse — a property called immutability, which has evidentiary implications.

### Smart contracts

A smart contract is a program stored on the blockchain that executes automatically when predefined conditions are met. The code is the contract; execution is automatic and does not require a human intermediary.

Legal implications:
- **Enforceability**: courts in most jurisdictions have not definitively answered whether smart contracts are legally binding contracts in the traditional sense. DIFC and ADGM have both taken steps toward recognizing them; UAE Federal Law does not yet have clear smart-contract-specific provisions.
- **Immutability vs. contract modification**: a deployed smart contract cannot be easily changed. This conflicts with the legal principle that contracts can be amended by mutual agreement.
- **Code bugs as legal risk**: a smart contract that executes "correctly" per its code but produces an outcome the parties did not intend raises questions about mistake, rectification, and liability.
- **Jurisdiction**: which court has jurisdiction over a dispute arising from a smart contract between anonymous parties on a global network? This remains unsettled.

### Gas and transaction costs

On Ethereum and similar networks, every transaction or smart contract execution requires a fee paid in the network's native currency ("gas"). Gas prices fluctuate with network demand. Legal implications: transaction costs at time of execution must be considered in commercial arrangements using smart contracts.

### Layer 2 networks

Layer 2 (L2) networks are secondary systems built on top of base blockchains (Layer 1) to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Examples: Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon on Ethereum. Legal implication: the security properties and finality guarantees of L2 transactions differ from L1; contracts should specify which layer governs.

### Bridges and MEV

Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains. They have been the target of major hacks (billions of dollars lost). MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is profit extracted by validators by reordering transactions. Both create liability and loss-causation questions in commercial disputes.

## MENA regulatory frameworks

### Dubai / UAE — Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)
- VARA was established by Dubai Law No. 4 of 2022.
- Governs virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in Dubai (including DIFC and DWTC free zones, but not ADGM).
- Requires licensing for virtual asset activities: exchange, brokerage, custody, investment management, advisory services.
- Applies to UAE Federal Virtual Assets Law (Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2022) at the federal level.
- AML/CFT requirements aligned with FATF guidance on virtual assets.

### ADGM — Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)
- ADGM has a separate virtual assets framework administered by the FSRA.
- Crypto Asset Framework initially introduced in 2018; updated since.
- Spot crypto asset trading and certain token offerings require FSRA approval.
- ADGM Courts have jurisdiction over smart-contract disputes for entities incorporated in ADGM.

### KSA
- Saudi Arabia's framework is still developing as of 2025.
- The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) and Capital Market Authority (CMA) have issued guidance but comprehensive virtual asset legislation has not yet been enacted.
- Crypto trading remains in a regulatory grey zone; certain activities are prohibited; proceed with significant caution on KSA virtual asset matters.

### Egypt
- Egypt's Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) regulates crypto-adjacent activities.
- The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has historically been skeptical of cryptocurrency; Bitcoin trading was effectively banned in 2018 but the position has evolved.
- Check current CBE and FRA guidance before advising on any Egypt digital asset matter.

### DIFC
- DIFC follows English common law; smart contracts are generally enforceable as contracts if they meet standard contract formation requirements (offer, acceptance, consideration, certainty of terms, intention to create legal relations).
- DIFC Courts have applied traditional contract law principles to digital asset disputes where they have arisen.

## Practical legal considerations

| Issue | Legal question |
|-------|---------------|
| Smart contract enforceability | Does the code manifest a binding agreement? Has the code been reviewed by a lawyer? |
| Dispute resolution | Which court or arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction? Is there an applicable governing law clause? |
| Immutability and mistake | If the code executes an unintended outcome, can the transaction be reversed? |
| Custody | Who controls the private key? Is this a custodial or non-custodial arrangement? |
| Token classification | Is the token a security, a commodity, a payment instrument, or a utility token? Classification determines the regulatory regime. |
| AML/KYC | VASPs must apply FATF-aligned KYC/AML procedures. Who is the beneficial owner behind a wallet address? |

## How to use this pack

Reference when advising on virtual asset transactions, smart contract arrangements, token issuance, or regulatory licensing in MENA jurisdictions. For KSA and Egypt, always verify the current regulatory position against the most recent guidance — these regimes are actively developing.

## Caveats and currency

Blockchain regulation in MENA is changing rapidly. VARA has issued multiple rulebooks since 2022; ADGM updates its framework; KSA's federal framework may crystallize. Verify specific regulatory positions before advising or filing. Do not cite specific article numbers from this pack without independent verification.
