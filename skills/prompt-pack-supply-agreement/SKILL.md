# Supply Agreement

## When to use this

Use this skill when:
- A supplier of goods (raw materials, manufactured products, commodities, finished consumer goods) needs a master supply agreement with a buyer covering an ongoing supply relationship.
- A buyer wants to establish a framework agreement with a supplier that will govern multiple purchase orders over time.
- An international supply chain arrangement needs documentation that covers cross-border delivery terms, quality controls, and dispute resolution.
- A company is entering a supply arrangement in a MENA market and needs to navigate local import regulations, certification requirements, and payment mechanisms.

**Distinguish from:** A services agreement (use [[prompt-pack-service-agreement]]) for performance of services; a reseller agreement (use [[prompt-pack-reseller-agreement]]) for re-sale of purchased goods to third parties.

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE — onshore (UAE Civil Transactions Law Arts. 524+ on Sale)
- UAE CTL governs sale of goods for UAE-based transactions; implied warranties of conformity and fitness for purpose are recognized.
- Inspection and rejection period: under UAE law, the buyer must inspect goods on delivery and raise defects promptly; delayed inspection may waive the right to reject.
- CISG: UAE is a signatory to the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG); the CISG applies to international sale of goods contracts between parties in different Contracting States unless excluded. Most commercial lawyers expressly exclude the CISG for clarity ("The parties exclude the application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods").
- Product certification: ESMA (Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology) certification required for many consumer and industrial products imported into UAE; ensure the supplier's goods have required ESMA approval.

### KSA
- SASO (Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization): mandatory product certification for many goods imported into KSA; supplier must confirm SASO compliance.
- Halal certification: required for food products; consider as a warranty in the Specifications.
- Interest on late payment: avoid conventional interest; rephrase as a penalty or delay compensation clause.

### DIFC / ADGM
- DIFC Contract Law governs; CISG exclusion recommended.
- Standard common-law sale of goods principles.

### Lebanon / Egypt
- Civil Code sale of goods provisions apply.
- CISG applies to international sales (both are Contracting States) unless excluded.

### EU / UK
- EU: Sale of Goods Directive (2019/771 for B2C; 2019/770 for digital goods); general contract law for B2B.
- UK: Sale of Goods Act 1979 and Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 for implied terms; mostly freely negotiated in B2B contracts.
- CISG: UK is not a Contracting State (post-Brexit); EU member states are.

## Drafting standards

- Attach the Specifications as a detailed Schedule 1 — the more precise the specification (including testing standards, tolerance levels, packaging requirements), the less room for dispute.
- Incoterms selection: always specify the version (Incoterms 2020); specify the named place precisely ("DAP, Port of Jebel Ali, UAE — Incoterms 2020").
- For long-term supply agreements: include a price review mechanism; fixed prices over a 5-year term with rising raw material costs will strain the relationship.
- Liquidated damages for late delivery: calibrate to actual loss; an excessive LD clause may be reduced by a court/tribunal (UAE CTL Art. 390; DIFC Contract Law).

## Common mistakes

- **No Incoterms specified.** When delivery terms are vague ("delivery to buyer's warehouse"), disputes arise about who bears the freight cost and when risk passes.
- **CISG not excluded.** If both parties are in CISG Contracting States and the agreement is silent on the CISG, it may apply and override certain negotiated provisions.
- **No minimum order quantity or take-or-pay.** Without purchase commitments, the supplier bears the risk of excess inventory and unused capacity; commercial agreements should allocate this risk.
- **Warranty period not pegged to actual use.** A warranty period from delivery date may expire before the goods are put into use; consider an alternative trigger (installation date, first use date).
