# Draft — Cap Table Resolution

## When to use this

A cap table resolution is required whenever a company's equity ownership structure changes. Without a board or shareholder resolution formally authorizing the change and directing the share register update, the equity event is not properly documented and may be challenged.

**Triggering events**:
- New share issuance (to new investor, existing shareholder, or employee)
- Option or warrant exercise
- Transfer of shares between existing shareholders
- Conversion of convertible note or SAFE into equity
- Share buyback or cancellation
- Creation of a new share class
- Reclassification or consolidation of existing shares
- Vesting acceleration event

## Required inputs

| Input | Notes |
|---|---|
| Triggering event | Identify the specific equity event |
| Pre-event cap table | All shareholders, classes, share count, percentage |
| Post-event cap table | After the change, reflecting new ownership |
| New shareholder details (if applicable) | Full legal name, nationality, address, ID/registration number |
| Share details | Class, number of new/transferred/cancelled shares |
| Consideration (if applicable) | Price per share; aggregate consideration; date of payment |
| Authorization basis | Subscription agreement, option exercise notice, board approval of transfer |
| Registrar filing requirement | Does the jurisdiction require a filing to update the commercial register? |

## Special cases

### Convertible note conversion
When a convertible note converts to equity:
- The resolution should reference the convertible note agreement, the conversion trigger event, and the conversion price calculation.
- Attach: (a) copy of the convertible note; (b) conversion calculation showing principal + accrued interest ÷ conversion price = shares issued; (c) acknowledgment that the note is cancelled upon conversion.

### Option exercise
- Reference the equity plan and option grant letter.
- Confirm the exercise price has been paid (or the exercise method: cash / net exercise / cashless exercise).
- Issue shares from the unissued option pool.

### SAFE conversion
- SAFEs convert on a "qualified financing" trigger.
- Board resolution should confirm that the triggering financing qualifies under the SAFE terms.
- Confirm the conversion price methodology (cap-implied price vs discount-implied price, whichever is lower).
- See [[draft-convertible-note]] for the SAFE vs note discussion.

## Common mistakes

- **No pre/post cap table in the resolution**: the resolution must contain or reference the updated cap table; it is the authoritative record.
- **Forgetting to cancel old share certificates**: uncancelled certificates can be used fraudulently; always cancel and reissue.
- **Missing registrar filing deadline**: in UAE and KSA, delayed filings can result in fines and the change not being recognized by third parties.
- **Conversion calculation not attached**: for convertible note or SAFE conversions, always attach the calculation as an exhibit to avoid future disputes about the share count.
- **Not updating option pool**: if shares are issued from the option pool, the resolution must note the remaining unissued pool size.
