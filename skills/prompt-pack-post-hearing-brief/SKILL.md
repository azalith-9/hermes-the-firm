# Post-Hearing Brief

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting a post-hearing brief (PHB) — the written submission filed after the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing in an arbitration or similar proceeding. The PHB is the party's last and often most important substantive submission: it synthesizes everything that was put in evidence, addresses witness credibility, makes the legal argument on full record, and tells the tribunal precisely what relief it should grant and why.

Post-hearing briefs are distinct from pre-hearing submissions and memorial-style briefs; they are backward-looking (analyzing what happened at the hearing) and forward-looking (directing the tribunal to the right outcome).

Triggers:
- "Draft our post-hearing brief for [Arbitration Case]."
- "The hearing concluded last week — now write our closing submission."
- "Draft written closing submissions for [Party] in the DIAC arbitration."

## Brief structure

### Cover page and procedural heading
Arbitration reference, parties, date of submission, title: "[Party]'s Post-Hearing Brief."

### I. Introduction (2–4 pages)

Open by orienting the tribunal to the key conclusion: "This hearing confirmed what [Party]'s evidence showed from the outset: [one-paragraph summary of the case in favor of the filing party]."

Address the hearing briefly: what was established, what was not, and why the outcome of the hearing supports [Party]'s position.

State the relief requested upfront — the tribunal should never have to search for what the party is asking for.

### II. Procedural History (1–2 pages)

Brief, factual summary:
- Nature of the dispute
- Date of commencement, seat, institution, and governing procedural rules
- Key procedural steps to date (SOC, SOD, Reply, Rejoinder, procedural orders)
- Hearing dates, witnesses who testified, experts who were examined

This section orients the tribunal and provides the citation backbone for the brief.

### III. Summary of Facts as Established by the Evidence

**Purpose**: Present the tribunal with the narrative of facts that the evidence at the hearing has established. This is not a repeat of the memorial — it focuses on what the hearing confirmed, clarified, or changed.

**Structure**:
- Organize chronologically or by issue, not by witness
- For each key fact, cite the exhibit number, witness testimony (transcript page reference), or expert report section that supports it
- Address facts that were contested at the hearing: explain why the tribunal should accept [Party]'s version (based on documentary evidence, credibility of witnesses, consistency with other evidence)

**Format**:
> "The [contract] required [Respondent] to deliver the equipment by [date]. (Exhibit 5, Clause 7.1.) [Respondent's witness, Mr. X] admitted in cross-examination that no equipment was delivered on [date]. (Transcript Day 2, pp. 45:12–46:3.) Claimant's contemporaneous communications confirm the delay. (Exhibit 23, Email of [Date].)"

### IV. Witness Credibility and Factual Findings

**Purpose**: Guide the tribunal in assessing the credibility of witnesses. Post-hearing briefs are the primary vehicle for credibility argument.

For each key witness:
- State what the witness was expected to say
- What the witness actually said
- Whether the testimony was consistent with the witness's prior written statements
- Whether the witness was successfully challenged or maintained their position under cross-examination
- Why the tribunal should accept or reject that witness's evidence on disputed points

**Example structure**:
- [Claimant's witness A]: credible; consistent under cross-examination; corroborated by documentary evidence at Exhibits [X, Y, Z]
- [Respondent's witness B]: not credible on [specific point] because: (i) testimony contradicted by Exhibit [C]; (ii) account changed materially from his witness statement at [page]; (iii) no documentary support for assertion that [...]

### V. Legal Analysis

For each claim or defense at issue:

**5.1 [Claim/Defense Title]**

1. **Legal standard**: State the applicable rule under the governing law. Cite to the named, well-established legal framework (e.g., "Under the DIFC Contract Law, a party in breach is liable for foreseeable direct and indirect losses"; "Under the ICC Rules, tribunal may award compound interest"). Do not fabricate article numbers or case citations not in the record.

2. **Application to the facts**: Apply the standard to the facts established at Section III. "The evidence establishes all elements of [claim]: [fact 1 → element 1], [fact 2 → element 2], [fact 3 → element 3]."

3. **Opposing party's arguments**: Address the opposing party's best arguments made in their submissions or advanced by their witnesses during the hearing. Explain specifically why each fails: factual basis is unsupported by the record; legal standard is misstated; the applicable law reaches a different conclusion.

4. **Conclusion on this issue**: state the conclusion clearly and with confidence.

### VI. Damages / Quantum

**Purpose**: Explain precisely what the party is seeking and why the evidence supports each element of relief.

**Structure**:
1. Applicable damages principles under the governing law (expectation damages / reliance damages / disgorgement / statutory damages)
2. For each head of damage:
   - Basis of the claim
   - Evidence of quantum (Claimant's expert report, financial records, comparable transactions)
   - Response to Respondent's quantum arguments
   - Specific amount requested

**Damages table**:
| Head of damage | Expert exhibit | Amount requested | Respondent's challenge | Response to challenge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Direct loss] | Exhibit X | USD Y | Challenges causation | Causation established by Transcript Day 1, pp. X–Y |
| [Consequential loss] | Exhibit Z | USD W | Says not foreseeable | Foreseeable under [governing law standard] because [reason] |
| [Interest] | | At [rate] from [date] | | |

**Interest**: State whether simple or compound interest is requested and from what date; explain the legal basis for the rate and compounding method requested.

### VII. Relief Requested

State the precise relief the tribunal is asked to grant, in numbered form. The final award must follow the prayer for relief; give the tribunal clear formulation to adopt.

> The Tribunal is respectfully requested to:
> 1. Award Claimant damages in the total amount of [USD X], comprising: (i) [USD Y] for [head 1]; (ii) [USD Z] for [head 2].
> 2. Award Claimant interest on the foregoing amounts at [rate] per annum, compounded [annually / semi-annually], from [date] until the date of the Award and thereafter at [rate] until full payment.
> 3. Order Respondent to bear the costs of the arbitration, including Claimant's reasonable legal costs.
> 4. Grant such other and further relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.

### VIII. Conclusion (1 paragraph)

Restate the case in one compelling paragraph. End with a clear statement of why the hearing has confirmed that the tribunal should grant the full relief requested.

## Style and format standards

- **Be precise on record citations**: every factual assertion must cite exhibit number, transcript page, or witness statement paragraph. Unreferenced assertions carry no weight.
- **Address the other side**: a PHB that ignores the opposing party's strongest points looks weak; engage and rebut.
- **Prefer short sentences in the relief section**: the tribunal may use the relief section as a template for the operative paragraphs of the award; write it as if it will be quoted verbatim.
- **Comply with page/word limits**: page limits are strictly enforced in major arbitration institutions; if there are competing priorities, prioritize damages and relief over procedural history.
- **No new evidence**: a PHB must work with the evidentiary record; parties generally cannot introduce new exhibits after the hearing closes without leave. Address this in the brief if a party seeks to make reference to something not in the record.

## Jurisdictional / institutional notes

| Forum | Notes |
|---|---|
| **ICC Arbitration** | Post-hearing briefs are common but not automatic; must be ordered by tribunal; typical page limit 50–100 pages; filed simultaneously unless tribunal orders sequential filing. |
| **DIAC (Dubai)** | DIAC Rules permit post-hearing submissions; tribunal has wide discretion; regional parties often file PHBs even if not specifically ordered. |
| **DIFC-LCIA / LCIA** | Well-developed PHB practice; LCIA tribunals frequently order PHBs; simultaneous filing common; transcript citations expected. |
| **SIAC** | Post-hearing submissions standard practice; SIAC Rules permit; Singapore-seated arbitrations follow English common-law procedural norms. |
| **ADCCAC (Abu Dhabi)** | Less standardized; follow tribunal's specific directions; Arabic-language version may be required depending on applicable law. |

## Common mistakes

- **Restating the pleadings rather than analyzing the hearing**: the PHB must engage with what actually happened at the hearing — witness credibility, what was established, what was challenged.
- **No record citations**: a PHB without transcript and exhibit citations is not taken seriously by experienced arbitrators; every key factual claim must be pinned to the record.
- **Omitting the damages table**: a narrative-only damages section is harder for the tribunal to work with when drafting the award; a clear table makes the tribunal's work easier.
- **Vague prayer for relief**: the prayer for relief must state specific amounts and interest rates; "such damages as the tribunal deems appropriate" is inadequate.
