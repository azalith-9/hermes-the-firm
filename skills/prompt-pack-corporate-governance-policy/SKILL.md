# Corporate Governance Policy

A Corporate Governance Policy formalises the structures and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. For listed companies it is a regulatory requirement; for private companies it is increasingly expected by investors, lenders, and regulators — and is the foundation of any credible compliance program.

## When to use this

- A company is preparing for a listing on a regulated exchange (DFM, ADX, Tadawul, LSE, NYSE, Nasdaq) where governance disclosure is mandatory.
- A private company is raising capital and investors require documented governance structures as a condition of investment.
- A company is expanding its board from a founder-controlled structure to include independent directors.
- Regulatory guidance (e.g., UAE Governance Code for public companies, SCA Governance Rules) requires a written governance policy.
- Following a corporate incident or audit finding that exposed governance gaps.
- A group of companies needs a uniform governance framework across multiple jurisdictions.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|---|---|---|
| Company name and jurisdiction of incorporation | Determines the applicable companies law and governance code | Ask the user |
| Company type (listed / private / family business / SOE) | Governance requirements and best practice differ materially | Ask the user |
| Applicable governance code | The policy should comply with any mandatory or applicable voluntary code | Ask the user; see jurisdiction notes below |
| Current board composition | The policy must reflect or improve on the current structure | Ask the user |
| Any specific investor or regulator requirements | Some investors or regulators require specific provisions | Ask the user |

## Optional inputs

- Whether the policy covers subsidiaries and group companies.
- Whether Sharia compliance considerations apply to the board's oversight role (relevant for Islamic finance companies in KSA, UAE, and Bahrain).
- Whether a Nomination and Remuneration Committee already exists or needs to be established.
- Whether the company has a Sharia Supervisory Board in addition to the main board.

## Document structure

### 1. Introduction and purpose
- The company's commitment to high standards of corporate governance.
- The purpose of the policy: to ensure the board operates effectively, consistently, and in compliance with applicable law.
- The governing law and governance code(s) to which the policy relates.
- Date of adoption and review cycle (recommend: annual review).

### 2. Board structure and composition

**2.1 Board size:**
- Define the minimum and maximum number of directors.
- Listed company requirements: UAE (SCA requires minimum 5 directors for listed companies); KSA (CMA requires minimum 5 for listed companies); DIFC/ADGM (companies law governs minimum).

**2.2 Director categories:**
- Executive directors (management role).
- Non-executive directors (oversight role).
- Independent non-executive directors: define independence using the applicable code standard.

**2.3 Independence criteria:**
A director is independent if they:
- Have not been an employee of the company in the past [5] years.
- Do not have a material business relationship with the company.
- Do not represent a significant shareholder.
- Do not have a family relationship with any executive director or senior manager.
- Have not served on the board for more than [9] years without re-evaluation of independence.

**UAE SCA Governance Rules for listed companies:** require at least one-third of board members to be independent non-executives. **KSA CMA:** at least two independent members or one-third, whichever is greater.

**2.4 Family business governance (MENA specific):**
In family businesses — which constitute the majority of MENA private companies — the board composition provisions should address: family vs. non-family directors, the role of a family governance council if any, separation of ownership and management roles, and succession planning across generations.

### 3. Director qualifications and fitness
- Minimum qualifications: relevant experience, financial literacy (at least one member with financial expertise), clean criminal record.
- Continuous professional development requirements.
- Disclosure obligations: directors must disclose any conflict of interest, change in outside directorships, or material change in personal circumstances.
- Fit and proper requirements for directors of regulated entities (DFSA, FSR, SAMA, UAE Insurance Authority).

### 4. Board meetings and decision-making

**4.1 Meeting frequency:**
- Minimum number of meetings per year (listed companies in UAE: at least 4 per year under SCA rules; KSA CMA: at least 4 per year).
- Quorum requirements.

**4.2 Agenda and information:**
- Board papers to be circulated [X] days before each meeting.
- Standard agenda: financials, operational performance, risk report, governance matters, strategic review (at least annually).

**4.3 Reserved matters:**
List decisions reserved for the board (not delegated to management). Minimum list for a commercial company:
- Approval of annual budget and business plan.
- Major capital expenditure above [threshold].
- Acquisitions, disposals, and investments above [threshold].
- Appointment and removal of CEO/CFO.
- Board and committee appointments.
- Material litigation.
- Related party transactions (especially important in MENA family business contexts).
- Approval of annual financial statements.
- Dividend approval.

### 5. Board committees
Describe each committee established:

**Audit Committee:**
- Composition (minimum [3] members; majority independent; at least one financial expert).
- Responsibilities: oversight of financial reporting, internal controls, external and internal audit, risk management.
- Mandatory for: UAE listed companies (SCA requirement); KSA listed companies (CMA requirement); DIFC/ADGM regulated entities.

**Nomination and Remuneration Committee:**
- Responsibilities: director nomination, independence assessment, succession planning, executive remuneration policy.
- KSA: CMA requires a Nomination and Remuneration Committee for listed companies.

**Risk Committee (for regulated entities and large companies):**
- Oversight of enterprise risk management framework.
- Reporting line to the full board.

**Sharia Supervisory Board (for Islamic finance entities):**
- Composition: minimum [3] scholars with relevant qualifications.
- Role: review and certify Sharia compliance of products and operations.
- Reporting: annual Sharia report to shareholders.
- Required for: UAE Islamic banks, KSA Islamic finance institutions, Bahrain financial institutions under CBB rules.

### 6. Board evaluation
- Annual performance evaluation of the board as a whole, individual directors, and each committee.
- Methodology: self-assessment questionnaire, peer review, or external facilitator (recommended for listed companies at least every 3 years).
- Results: discussed at a board meeting; action plan prepared for any identified gaps.

### 7. Succession planning
- Identification of potential successors for the CEO, CFO, and other key management roles.
- Emergency succession plan (immediate step-up if key person is incapacitated).
- Director succession: proactive identification of candidates for board vacancies; avoid cliff-edge where many independent directors retire simultaneously.
- MENA family businesses: plan must address generational succession and the role of non-family management.

### 8. Shareholder engagement
- Annual General Meeting (AGM): timing, notice requirements, and agenda.
- Minority shareholder rights: information rights, voting rights, related-party transaction approvals.
- Dividend policy: criteria and declaration process.
- Investor relations for listed companies: disclosure obligations, quiet period policy, insider trading policy.
- **UAE:** Federal Companies Law requirements for AGM timing and shareholder notice.
- **KSA:** Companies Law (Royal Decree M/3, 2015 as amended) governs AGM requirements.

### 9. Related party transactions
One of the most important governance provisions in MENA:
- Define related parties (directors, major shareholders, their family members and associated entities).
- Require board approval for any transaction with a related party above a specified threshold.
- Require independent director approval for transactions where a director has a personal interest.
- Listed companies must disclose related party transactions in their annual reports (SCA and CMA rules).
- Maintain a register of interests.

### 10. Reporting and transparency
- Annual report governance section: mandatory disclosures for listed companies.
- ESG / sustainability reporting: increasingly required by DFM, ADX, Tadawul, and institutional investors.
- Whistleblowing: reference to the company's Code of Conduct or speak-up policy.

### 11. Review and amendment
- The policy is reviewed annually by the board (or a designated committee).
- Amendments require board approval.
- Local counsel in each operating jurisdiction reviews the policy before adoption and after any material regulatory change.

## Jurisdictional governance codes

| Jurisdiction | Primary governance instrument |
|---|---|
| UAE (listed) | SCA Corporate Governance Rules for Joint Stock Companies (SCA Decision No. 7 of 2016, as amended) |
| UAE (DIFC) | DIFC Companies Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2018) and DFSA CIR/GEN Rulebooks for regulated entities |
| UAE (ADGM) | ADGM Companies Regulations 2020 and FSRA regulations for regulated entities |
| KSA (listed) | CMA Corporate Governance Regulations (updated 2017) |
| Lebanon | Lebanese Companies Law (Decree No. 304 of 1942 as amended); no mandatory listed company code (Beirut Stock Exchange has guidelines) |
| Egypt (listed) | EGX Corporate Governance Code; Financial Regulatory Authority rules |
| GCC (Islamic finance) | AAOIFI Governance Standards (voluntary but widely adopted) |

## Common mistakes

- A policy that lists governance obligations without assigning them to specific bodies (board, committee, management) — unassigned obligations are ignored.
- Independence criteria that are less stringent than the applicable regulatory code — this creates a compliance gap for listed companies.
- No reserved matters list — without it, management takes decisions that should require board approval.
- Related party transaction controls that are aspirational but have no enforcement mechanism (no approval gate, no register).
- Failing to update the policy after listing rules change — governance codes are revised periodically; the policy must track them.
