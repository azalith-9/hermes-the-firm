# Draft Reply to Department Notice

## When to use this

Use this skill when a company or individual has received a formal notice from a government department or regulatory authority and requires a professionally drafted, legally grounded reply. Government notices demand careful, timely responses — the reply creates an official record, may preserve appeal rights, and can affect penalty outcomes.

Common department notice types:
- Tax authority notices (deficiency assessment, audit request, penalty notice, request for information)
- Labor/employment department notices (inspection, violation notice, worker complaint)
- Financial regulator notices (licensing inquiry, compliance breach, AML/KYC deficiency)
- Customs and trade authority notices (misclassification, valuation dispute, import prohibition)
- Municipal or building authority notices (planning, occupancy, safety)
- Central bank or payment authority notices (e-money, payment system licensing)
- Data protection authority notices (data breach, GDPR/PDPL inquiry)

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| The original department notice | The substance to be responded to | Must be provided; cannot draft without it |
| Responding party (client) name and registration details | Identity on record with the authority | Ask |
| Jurisdiction and authority name | Determines applicable laws, procedures, and precedent | Ask |
| Response deadline | Many notices have strict response windows; missing them waives rights | Ask; flag urgency if less than 7 days |
| Client's position on the substance | Do they contest, accept with explanation, or partially comply? | Ask in detail |
| Supporting documents to attach | Proof of compliance, payment records, correspondence | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Prior correspondence with the authority on the same matter
- Relevant judicial or administrative tribunal decisions (if client has knowledge of favorable precedents)
- Audit or third-party expert report supporting the client's position
- Certified translations (if the authority's notice was in a different language than the response)

## Document structure

1. **Header and reference** — Authority name and address; date; reference number of the original notice; subject: "Reply to Notice Reference [X] dated [date]."

2. **Opening acknowledgment** — Confirm receipt of the notice; identify the responding party; note the matter in general terms: "We write on behalf of [Client] in response to your notice dated [date] concerning [subject]."

3. **Factual background** — A brief, accurate account of the relevant facts from the client's perspective:
   - The client's business and its relationship to the authority's jurisdiction
   - What the notice alleges or requests
   - What the client's position is

4. **Legal and factual submissions** — The substantive response, organized by issue:

   **If contesting the notice:**
   - Identify the specific grounds of disagreement (factual error, legal misapplication, procedural defect in the notice)
   - Cite applicable statutory provisions, regulations, or administrative guidance
   - Reference any favorable precedents or published authority guidance (without fabricating citations)
   - Submit supporting evidence

   **If accepting with explanation:**
   - Acknowledge the finding; explain any mitigating circumstances
   - Identify corrective action already taken or proposed
   - Request reduction of penalty based on cooperation and remediation

   **If requesting clarification or extension:**
   - Note which part of the notice is unclear or requires additional time to respond to
   - Request specific relief: "We respectfully request an extension of [X] days to gather the documentation requested in Item 3 of the notice."

5. **Procedural rights reservation** — Where applicable, expressly reserve the right to appeal or file an administrative review if the authority issues an adverse decision.

6. **Undertakings (if appropriate)** — Specific commitments the client is willing to make: remediation steps, payment plans, compliance undertakings. Only include if the client has authorized them.

7. **Attachments list** — Number and describe each exhibit attached.

8. **Closing and signature** — Formal close; authorized signatory's name, title, and contact details.

## Jurisdictional notes

### Tax authority notices — MENA

| Jurisdiction | Authority | Key considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **UAE** | Federal Tax Authority (FTA); Ministry of Finance | VAT and Excise Tax administered by FTA; response periods specified in the Federal Tax Procedure Law; objection then appeal to Tax Disputes Resolution Committee before court |
| **KSA** | Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) | Zakat (for Saudi entities) and income tax (for foreign entities) and VAT; formal objection within 60 days of assessment; review then tax appeal committee |
| **Lebanon** | Ministry of Finance — Tax Directorate | Income tax, built property tax, VAT; formal contestation within 30 days of assessment; contentious and often delayed process |
| **Egypt** | Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) | Income tax, VAT; internal appeal then Tax Appeals Commission; Egyptian courts have jurisdiction over final appeals |

### Labor/employment authority notices — MENA

- **UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization (MoHRE)**: Notices regarding Emiratization quotas, labor camp standards, or worker complaints require response and may trigger on-site inspection; consider whether to engage MoHRE's conciliation service.
- **KSA Ministry of Human Resources**: Nitaqat program compliance notices; Saudization quota requirements; responses should demonstrate compliance or propose a remediation plan with timeline.
- **Lebanon Ministry of Labor**: Notices regarding NSSF (social security) contributions, illegal employment, or worker claims; engage labor law counsel given political sensitivity.

### Financial regulatory notices — MENA

- **UAE Central Bank / SCA / CBUAE**: Notices about AML/KYC deficiencies require immediate acknowledgment and a remediation plan within the notice period; unresponsive institutions face license suspension.
- **DIFC / ADGM FSRA / DFSA**: Notices are formally structured; right to make representations before enforcement action is triggered; sophisticated regulatory process.
- **KSA Capital Market Authority**: CMA enforcement notices require formal written response; legal representation is common.

### Civil-law notice response formalities

In Lebanon, Egypt, and France, responses to regulatory notices often need to be:
- In the official language of the authority
- Signed by an authorized legal representative
- Submitted via the prescribed channel (physical delivery to the ministry, or digital portal if available)
- Accompanied by certified copies of supporting documents

## Drafting standards

- Adopt a formal, professional, respectful tone throughout — avoid adversarial language; authorities are not opposing parties yet.
- Organize the response clearly by reference to the sections/items in the original notice; make it easy for the official to follow.
- Do not make admissions that are not strategically deliberate — every sentence may become part of a subsequent enforcement record.
- Distinguish between factual submissions (what happened) and legal submissions (why the law does not apply or why the penalty should be reduced).
- If requesting an extension, provide a genuine reason and a specific proposed new deadline.
- In tax responses, always include supporting calculations and source documents for any figures relied upon.

## Common mistakes

- **Missing the response deadline**: In UAE, KSA, and most MENA jurisdictions, failing to respond within the stipulated period can result in the authority's assessment or finding becoming final and unappealable.
- **Admitting liability unintentionally**: Phrases like "we apologize for the oversight" or "the error occurred because..." can constitute admissions; use carefully.
- **Not reserving appeal rights**: The reply should always note that the client reserves all rights to challenge any adverse decision.
- **Submitting incomplete supporting documents**: A well-written letter without the supporting evidence it references is weaker than a plain letter with the documents.
- **Wrong language**: UAE FTA requires Arabic submissions for formal objections; ensure Arabic translation is certified and accurate.
- **Underestimating urgency**: Department notices often have 15–30 day response windows; escalate to the client immediately on receipt.
