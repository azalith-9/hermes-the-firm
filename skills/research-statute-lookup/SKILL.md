# Statute Lookup

Retrieve the current verbatim text of a statute, article, or regulation from its authoritative source. This skill quotes the text exactly as enacted — it never paraphrases. It also provides the citation, effective date, amendment history, and a link to the authoritative source so the reader can verify.

## When to use this

- A lawyer drafting a legal opinion needs to quote the exact statutory text
- A contract drafter needs to verify that a compliance clause correctly reflects the applicable law
- A court submission requires a verbatim statutory quotation with citation
- A compliance team is building a control framework anchored to specific statutory articles
- A researcher needs the original instrument before analyzing regulator guidance or case law that interprets it

**Do not use this** when you need regulator interpretation — that is [[research-regulator-guidance-lookup]]. Do not use this when you need recent changes — pair this with [[research-recent-amendments-tracker]].

## Inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Statute or law name | The instrument to look up | Required — or provide subject area if name not known |
| Specific article(s) | Retrieves targeted text; avoid returning the entire law if only 1–2 articles are needed | Provide if known |
| Jurisdiction | Different jurisdictions have different sources | Required |
| Effective date / version date | For historical analysis or dispute about what law applied at a past date | Default: current consolidated version |
| Language preference | Many MENA instruments exist in Arabic only; English translation may be unofficial | Note Arabic-only instruments |

## Output structure

```
## [Statute Name]

**Jurisdiction**: [jurisdiction]
**Citation**: [full citation — decree/law number, date]
**Effective date**: [date law entered into force]
**Last amended**: [date; consolidated to [date] if consolidated version]
**Authoritative source**: [URL or reference to official portal]

**Status**: In force | Repealed | Superseded by [instrument name]

---

### Article [X] — [Article heading if available]

> [Verbatim text of the article, in original language]

**English translation** *(unofficial — original controls)*:
[Translation if the original is Arabic or French and no official English version exists]

**Notes**: [Any amendment to this article since enactment; version differences]

---
```

## The verbatim rule

**Never paraphrase article text.** A paraphrase, however careful, risks:
- Omitting a condition or exception that is legally material ("unless" clauses are frequently paraphrased out)
- Changing the meaning of a term of art (Arabic legal terms frequently have specific jurisprudential meanings that are lost in casual translation)
- Creating a misstatement that could mislead a client or court

If a verbatim quote is too long to reproduce in full, quote the specific sub-articles or paragraphs that are directly relevant, and note the omission.

## Caution on MENA database lag

MENA legal databases — including commercial and official portals — frequently lag the official gazette publication by days to weeks. For laws enacted or amended within the last 3 months:
1. Explicitly flag the lag risk in the output
2. Run [[research-recent-amendments-tracker]] to check whether a more recent version exists
3. Recommend the user obtain a certified extract from the official gazette for mission-critical reliance

**Hijri vs Gregorian dates**: KSA instruments use Hijri calendar in the official citation. Always specify both when citing a KSA instrument (e.g., "Royal Decree M/51 of 1426 AH (2005 AD)"). Ambiguity in the calendar can cause a party to reference a completely different instrument.
