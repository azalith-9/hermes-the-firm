# Whistleblower Policy

## When to use this

Use this skill when:

- A company is establishing or revising a whistleblower / "speak-up" policy as part of its corporate governance framework
- An entity must comply with mandatory whistleblower reporting requirements (EU Whistleblower Directive, US Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, UK PIDA, DIFC / ADGM governance standards)
- A board or audit committee requires a policy documenting the anonymous reporting channel and anti-retaliation protections
- An M&A legal team identifies that the target lacks a compliant whistleblower policy during due diligence
- A company is responding to a regulatory inquiry about its internal controls and needs to demonstrate an operative speak-up system

The policy must be genuinely operational — not boilerplate. A policy that exists on paper but is not trained, communicated, or enforced provides minimal legal protection and may itself become evidence in a regulatory proceeding.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Company name and sector | Shapes which concerns are reportable and which regulatory frameworks apply | Prompt user |
| Jurisdictions of operation | Determines mandatory requirements and anti-retaliation scope | All jurisdictions where company employs or contracts workers |
| Reporting channel options | Internal (HR, legal, hotline, ombudsman) vs. external; anonymous vs. identified | Include at least one anonymous channel; external option recommended |
| Applicable whistleblower laws | Mandatory framework reference | Per jurisdiction (see notes below) |
| Scope of covered persons | Employees only, or also contractors, suppliers, former employees | Broad coverage recommended; EU Directive requires contractors |

## Optional inputs

- **Third-party hotline provider** — many companies use external anonymous hotline (e.g., EthicsPoint, NAVEX, SpeakUp); specify in the policy
- **Audit committee / board oversight role** — whether the audit committee receives all reports or only those involving senior management
- **Existing internal investigation procedure** — policy should cross-reference the investigation procedure
- **Multilingual requirements** — policy must be accessible in all languages of the company's workforce
- **Confidentiality procedure for legal hold** — hotline records may be subject to legal hold; address in data retention section

## Document structure

1. **Purpose and commitment** — company's commitment to ethical conduct and open reporting; purpose of the policy (create a safe reporting environment; detect and remediate wrongdoing; comply with applicable law)

2. **Scope — who is covered** — all employees (permanent, temporary, part-time); contractors, consultants, and agents; former employees (for matters they reported during employment); members of the company's board; third-party suppliers and joint venture partners (if applicable); specific inclusion of workers in all jurisdictions

3. **What can be reported (reportable concerns)** — non-exhaustive list:
   - Fraud, corruption, bribery, kickbacks
   - Financial irregularities, accounting fraud, securities fraud
   - Health and safety violations
   - Environmental breaches
   - Data protection and privacy violations
   - Harassment, discrimination, or bullying
   - Conflicts of interest not disclosed
   - Violations of company policy or applicable law
   - Retaliation against a prior reporter
   - Government contract or procurement violations
   - Sanctions and export control violations (for MENA entities operating internationally)

4. **How to report — reporting channels**
   - **Internal channels:** direct manager (if not implicated), HR, legal department, compliance officer
   - **Anonymous hotline:** 24/7 third-party operated; caller ID not recorded; accessible in [relevant languages]
   - **Board / audit committee channel:** for concerns involving senior management, CFO, or CEO
   - **External reporting:** company encourages internal reporting first but acknowledges employees' legal right to report to external regulators (DFSA, SCA, FCA, SEC, relevant labor authority, etc.) — anti-retaliation protections apply regardless of which channel is used
   - Specify contact details for each channel

5. **Confidentiality** — reporter's identity protected to the maximum extent possible consistent with conducting a fair investigation; when disclosure is unavoidable (e.g., criminal proceedings), reporter is informed in advance; information about the report shared only on a need-to-know basis; records stored securely; data protection law compliance

6. **Anti-retaliation protections** — company strictly prohibits retaliation against any person who reports in good faith; prohibited retaliation includes: dismissal, demotion, salary reduction, harassment, threats, blacklisting, negative performance reviews, refusal of promotion; definition of "good faith" (reporter genuinely believed concern was valid; knowingly false reports are not protected); remedies for retaliated-against reporters (reinstatement, compensation, legal action); managers personally liable for authorized retaliation

7. **Investigation procedure** — reference to separate [[prompt-pack-workplace-investigation-plan]]; key commitments in this policy: initial triage within [5 business days]; acknowledgment to reporter (where not anonymous); investigation by qualified, impartial investigator; conclusion within [60–90 days] unless extension documented; feedback to reporter on outcome (in general terms, preserving third-party confidentiality)

8. **Disclosure and false reports** — reporter duty to report accurately to the best of their knowledge; deliberately false or malicious reports may constitute misconduct subject to disciplinary action; this provision must be narrowly drafted to not chill legitimate reporting

9. **Record-keeping and data protection** — hotline records retained for [5–7 years] or as required by local law; access restricted to investigation team; records subject to company data protection policy; data subject rights of the reported individual are addressed in the investigation procedure

10. **Governance** — policy owned by [General Counsel / Chief Compliance Officer]; annual review cycle; board / audit committee receives annual summary of reports, outcomes, and trends (anonymized); amendment process; version control

11. **Communication and training** — policy distributed to all covered persons; new-hire training required; annual refresher; managers trained on anti-retaliation obligations; accessible on company intranet in all relevant languages

12. **Governing law** — policy is governed by applicable law in each jurisdiction of operation; where there is conflict between this policy and local law, the more protective standard applies

## Jurisdictional notes

| Jurisdiction | Key instrument | Notable requirement |
|---|---|---|
| EU | Directive (EU) 2019/1937 (Whistleblower Protection Directive), transposed by 2021 | Mandatory for companies with 50+ employees; 3-month report feedback deadline; anonymous reporting channel required; broad personal scope (contractors, shareholders); ban on retaliation including in civil proceedings |
| UK | Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) + Employment Rights Act | "Protected disclosure" if worker reasonably believes information is true and in the public interest; employment tribunal remedy; no separate mandatory hotline requirement (but good practice) |
| DIFC | DIFC Employment Law 2019 Art. 62 — protected disclosures; DFSA conduct rules for regulated firms | DFSA requires regulated entities to have effective whistleblower arrangements; DIFC Court will enforce anti-retaliation claims |
| ADGM | ADGM Employment Regulations 2019; FSRA conduct requirements for regulated entities | Similar to DIFC; FSRA requires robust speak-up culture |
| UAE (onshore) | No comprehensive whistleblower law; Labour Law (Federal Decree-Law 33/2021) protects against unfair dismissal; sector-specific rules (Central Bank, SCA) | Policy operates primarily as contractual commitment; Central Bank Circular requiring banks to have compliance reporting channels |
| KSA | No standalone whistleblower law; SAMA (Saudi Central Bank) requires financial institutions to have complaint and reporting mechanisms; Combating Corruption Commission (Nazaha) public reporting channel | Policy should align with SAMA reporting requirements for financial sector; Arabic version required for employee-facing documents |
| Lebanon | Code of Obligations and Contracts applies; Labor Law protects against arbitrary dismissal; no standalone whistleblower statute | Policy provides contractual protection; courts apply general employment and tort principles |
| Egypt | No comprehensive whistleblower law; Egyptian Labor Law; CBE circulars for banking sector | CBE requires banks to have internal reporting mechanisms; general anti-retaliation based on Labor Law Art. 69 |
| US | Sarbanes-Oxley Act (public companies); Dodd-Frank Act (securities violations — SEC bounty program); FCPA enforcement context | SOX requires audit committee reporting channel; Dodd-Frank provides financial rewards for tips leading to SEC enforcement; policies must not obstruct protected disclosures |

**MENA cultural note:** In Gulf cultures, a "speak-up" culture may be less developed than in Western organizations. The policy should be supplemented with training that emphasizes the company's genuine commitment to non-retaliation and that addresses the cultural stigma around "reporting on colleagues." Manager training is particularly important.

**Language requirement:** In UAE and KSA, employee-facing policies should be in Arabic (or bilingual with Arabic). A policy only in English that employees cannot read provides minimal protection in labor proceedings.

## Drafting standards

- **Anti-retaliation clause must have teeth** — specify concrete remedies (reinstatement, compensation), not just a vague policy statement
- **Anonymous channel is not optional** — employees will not report if they fear identification; even where confidentiality cannot be guaranteed (e.g., small team), state the commitment clearly
- **Do not conflate with grievance procedure** — whistleblower reports concern wrongdoing by others; personal grievances are handled separately; confusing the two dilutes both
- **Feedback obligation** — the EU Directive requires feedback within 3 months; even outside EU, committing to feedback (in general terms) increases trust in the system
- **False reporting carve-out must be narrow** — broad language threatening discipline for "unsubstantiated" reports will chill legitimate disclosures

## Common mistakes

- **Policy exists but is not communicated** — a policy that employees don't know about offers no protection
- **No anonymous channel** — anonymous channels are the standard for effective reporting; identified-only systems generate under-reporting
- **Anti-retaliation clause too vague** — "the company does not retaliate" without specifics is unenforceable
- **No feedback mechanism** — reporters who hear nothing assume their report was ignored; required by EU Directive and best practice elsewhere
- **Conflating with HR grievance procedure** — whistleblower reports should go to compliance / legal, not HR, to avoid conflicts of interest
- **Single language** — non-English-speaking employees may not understand or use an English-only policy
