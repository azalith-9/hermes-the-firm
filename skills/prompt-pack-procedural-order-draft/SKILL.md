# Procedural Order Draft

## When to use this

Use this skill when:
- An arbitral tribunal or the parties to an arbitration need a comprehensive Procedural Order No. 1 setting out the entire procedural framework for the case.
- A party representative (claimant's or respondent's counsel) wants to circulate a draft order to the tribunal for adoption or adaptation.
- A subsequent procedural order is needed (e.g., Procedural Order No. 2 on document production, Procedural Order No. 3 on expert evidence).
- Counsel needs to propose specific procedural rules at the first case-management conference (CMC).

This skill is procedural, not substantive — it concerns *how* the arbitration runs, not the merits. For the underlying substantive pleadings, use [[prompt-pack-statement-of-claim]] or [[prompt-pack-statement-of-defense-arbitration]].

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| **Arbitration case reference** | Identifies the case in the order's header | "[Case Ref TBD]" |
| **Arbitral institution and applicable rules** | Determines mandatory procedural requirements and deadlines | Ask; note that ICC, LCIA, DIAC, UNCITRAL each have different frameworks |
| **Seat of arbitration** | Determines the lex arbitri (curial law) governing procedural challenges | Ask; key seats: Dubai (UAE Arbitration Law, Federal Law No. 6 of 2018), DIFC, ADGM, Riyadh, Beirut, Paris, London |
| **Number of arbitrators and their identities** | Affects how the order is signed and how deliberations are referenced | Tribunal of [1/3] yet to be constituted vs. constituted |
| **Agreed procedural positions (if any)** | Reduces contested content; records what parties have agreed | None — draft as if no prior agreement unless instructed |

## Optional inputs

- **Agreed or proposed timetable dates** — counsel often exchange a draft Gantt chart; incorporate if provided.
- **Document production method preference** — Redfern schedule vs. IBA Rules on Evidence model; UNCITRAL Model vs. civil-law documentary approach.
- **Language of proceedings** — especially important in MENA where Arabic-language proceedings are sometimes required.
- **Seat-specific mandatory rules** — e.g., under UAE Federal Law No. 6 of 2018, certain rights cannot be waived by procedural order.
- **Confidentiality concerns** — whether to include a strict confidentiality provision or adopt the institution's default.

## Document structure

1. **Preamble** — case reference, names of parties, institution, applicable rules, date of constitution of the tribunal, date and form of CMC.
2. **Procedural timetable** — table or numbered list of milestones:
   - Statement of Claim / Memorial deadline
   - Statement of Defense / Counter-Memorial deadline
   - Reply Memorial (if permitted)
   - Rejoinder (if permitted)
   - Document production round(s)
   - Witness statement exchange
   - Expert report exchange
   - Pre-hearing conference
   - Final hearing dates
3. **Document production** — whether IBA Rules on Evidence apply; Redfern schedule process; relevance and materiality standards; form of production (native, PDF); privilege rules (which law governs privilege — lex arbitri vs. law of the document).
4. **Witness evidence**
   - Written witness statements in lieu of direct examination (standard in international arbitration)
   - Witness statement deadline, format, language
   - Right to call witnesses; notification procedure
   - Treatment of witness conferencing ("hot-tubbing") if adopted
5. **Expert evidence**
   - Party-appointed vs. tribunal-appointed experts
   - Expert report format and deadline
   - Joint memorandum of experts (identifying agreed/disagreed issues)
   - Tribunal-appointed expert: procedure, terms of reference
6. **Hearing logistics**
   - Dates, venue or virtual platform
   - Sequence of presentations
   - Time allocation (chess-clock or equal-time model)
   - Interpretation requirements (Arabic/English/French)
   - Transcription and real-time transcript services
7. **Confidentiality**
   - Scope: pleadings, awards, and evidence all confidential
   - Exceptions: enforcement proceedings, disclosure required by law, professional regulatory obligations
   - Specific restrictions on disclosure to related entities
8. **Communications with the tribunal**
   - All communications through the institution's case management system or designated channel
   - Ex parte communications prohibition
   - Emergency/urgent applications procedure
9. **Miscellaneous**
   - Costs reserved
   - Modification of procedural order
   - Applicable law on substance (noted for reference, not decided here)
10. **Signatures** — tribunal member(s) and date; parties' acknowledgment if the order is agreed.

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE — onshore (Federal Law No. 6 of 2018 on Arbitration)
- Modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law; arbitration-friendly.
- Seat in Dubai or Abu Dhabi (onshore): parties may agree to exclude or modify many procedural provisions except those touching public policy.
- DIAC Rules (2022) provide detailed CMC procedures; Procedural Order No. 1 is expected within 30 days of constitution.
- Arabic-language requirement for enforcement proceedings in UAE courts means it is prudent to produce Arabic translations of the final award; not necessarily for interim procedural orders.

### DIFC Arbitration Centre (DIAC International)
- DIFC Arbitration Law (DIFC Law No. 1 of 2008, as amended) applies when the seat is DIFC.
- Procedural orders cannot be enforced against third parties in DIFC courts without a separate court order.
- Tribunal has broad discretion on procedure; parties commonly adopt IBA Rules on Evidence.

### ADGM Arbitration Centre
- ADGM Arbitration Regulations 2015 (UNCITRAL Model Law-based).
- Common-law procedural culture: witness cross-examination expected; witness statements standard.

### KSA — Saudi Center for Commercial Arbitration (SCCA)
- Saudi Arbitration Law (Royal Decree M/34 of 2012) and SCCA Rules 2023.
- Arabic is the default language of proceedings unless parties agree otherwise.
- Procedural orders must comply with Islamic law (Sharia) principles — e.g., interest (riba) provisions cannot be included in substantive orders but procedural orders are generally unaffected.
- Tribunal powers to order document production are somewhat narrower than in common-law seats.

### Egypt — Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (CRCICA)
- Egyptian Arbitration Law No. 27 of 1994 (UNCITRAL Model Law-based).
- CRCICA Rules 2011 (as amended).
- Courts have occasionally intervened in procedural matters; ensure order language is precise to avoid grounds for challenge.

### Lebanon — Lebanese Arbitration Centre / Ad hoc
- Lebanon's Code of Civil Procedure (Arts. 762–814) governs domestic arbitration; New York Convention applies to international.
- Political instability has affected institutional capacity; ad hoc arbitration with Paris seat is common for Lebanese parties.

### France (Paris) — ICC / ICDR
- OHADA reference for West African parties often uses Paris seat.
- French lex arbitri (Code of Civil Procedure Arts. 1442–1527) is highly arbitration-friendly; courts intervene minimally.

## Drafting standards

- Use numbered paragraphs throughout for ease of reference and amendment.
- Express all deadlines as specific calendar dates (not "within X days of Y") to avoid disputes about counting.
- Distinguish between "shall" (mandatory) and "may" (discretionary) consistently.
- Attach a procedural timetable as an annex in table form — easier to revise at subsequent CMCs.
- Avoid prejudging substantive legal issues (applicable law, validity of clause, jurisdiction) in the procedural order; include a carve-out: "Nothing in this Order prejudges any issue of jurisdiction, merits, or liability."
- Include a version/amendment history at the bottom so superseded orders are traceable.

## Common mistakes

- **Importing US-style discovery rules** into a civil-law or MENA seat proceeding. Document production in MENA arbitration is narrower than US discovery; do not replicate "all documents relating to" formulations.
- **Omitting language of proceedings.** In MENA, the language issue (Arabic vs. English vs. French) is often contested; fixing it in Procedural Order No. 1 avoids later disputes.
- **Vague confidentiality clauses.** "The proceedings are confidential" without specifying scope creates disputes; enumerate what is covered.
- **Failing to address third-party funding disclosure.** ICC, LCIA, and DIAC rules increasingly require disclosure of TPF; the procedural order should set a deadline.
- **No mechanism for urgent applications.** Without an emergency procedure, parties may rush to national courts; include a 48-hour notice provision for urgent relief requests to the tribunal.
