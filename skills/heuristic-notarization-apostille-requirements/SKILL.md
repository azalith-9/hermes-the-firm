# Notarization and Apostille Requirements

## When this applies

Proactively surface this heuristic whenever:
- A power of attorney, certificate of incorporation, board resolution, or personal-status document is being used outside its country of origin.
- A document is being filed with a foreign court, government authority, or registry.
- A cross-border transaction requires authentication of signatures or corporate authority.
- The user is moving a document between two MENA jurisdictions or between a MENA jurisdiction and a non-MENA jurisdiction.

Getting the authentication chain wrong delays transactions by weeks. This is a high-value proactive flag.

## Authentication chain overview

Documents used outside their country of origin typically require one of two authentication chains:

### Chain 1 — Hague Apostille (for Convention signatory states)

**Step 1**: Notary Public certifies the signature (or, for public documents, the official's capacity).

**Step 2**: Apostille is issued by the designated competent authority (varies by country — typically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, or Secretary of State's office).

**Result**: the document is recognized in all ~120 Apostille-signatory states without further authentication.

This chain is simpler, faster, and cheaper than consular legalization.

### Chain 2 — Consular legalization (for non-signatory states or non-Convention documents)

Required when either the origin country or the destination country is not a Hague Apostille signatory, or when the document type is excluded from the Convention.

**Steps**:
1. Notary Public certifies the signature.
2. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the origin country authenticates the notary's signature.
3. Consulate or Embassy of the destination country in the origin country legalizes the MFA authentication.
4. (Optional additional steps): MFA of the destination country may require a further attestation.

This chain can take 2–6 weeks depending on the countries involved.

## Apostille signatories relevant to MENA practice

### Signatory states (Apostille applies)
- UAE (acceded — applicable for documents issued in UAE for use abroad; UAE courts accept apostilled foreign documents)
- UK, EU member states, US, France, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, most Latin American states

### Non-signatories (consular legalization required)
- **KSA** — not a party to the Hague Apostille Convention. Documents from KSA for use abroad (or foreign documents for use in KSA) require full consular legalization.
- **Qatar** — acceded in 2023; verify current acceptance practices.
- **Lebanon** — acceded; however, the practical functioning of the authentication chain has been affected by administrative disruptions since 2019; verify with local counsel.
- **Egypt** — acceded; accept apostilled documents.
- **Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman** — verify current status; GCC states have been joining at different times.

**Rule of thumb**: if KSA is either the origin or destination, assume full consular legalization is required unless local counsel confirms otherwise.

## Jurisdiction-specific notarization requirements

### Lebanon

**Notary Public (Notaire Public)**: appointed by the Ministry of Justice; notarizes signatures and certifies documents.

**Authentication chain for cross-border use**:
1. Notary Public authentication.
2. Ministry of Justice stamp.
3. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) stamp.
4. Destination country consulate legalization.

**Tawqi3i (Lebanese e-notarization)**: the Lebanese e-notarization system introduced digital notarial certificates. Cross-border recognition of Tawqi3i certificates is still developing; for critical cross-border use, maintain a parallel paper-notarized chain until the digital chain is formally accepted by the destination country.

### KSA

**Notary Public**: appointed under the Ministry of Justice. Documents requiring notarization must be presented to the notary in person or via a licensed intermediary.

**Authentication chain for use abroad**:
1. Ministry of Justice authentication.
2. MFA authentication.
3. Foreign country's embassy in Riyadh legalization.

**For corporate documents (board resolutions, PoA)**: additional authentication by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce may be required for commercial documents used in trade transactions. Verify with the specific destination authority.

**Apostille note**: KSA is not an Apostille signatory as of 2025. Any KSA-origin document for use in an Apostille-signatory country still requires consular legalization, not an Apostille.

### UAE

**Notary Public**: both federal (Ministry of Justice) and emirate-level notaries operate. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and other emirates have their own notarial infrastructure.

**Authentication chain for use abroad**:
1. Notary Public.
2. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) attestation (can be done at MOFA offices or via approved typing centers).
3. Destination country embassy legalization (if destination is a non-Apostille state).

**For Apostille-destination countries**: Notary + MOFA apostille (UAE acceded to the Hague Convention; MOFA issues Apostilles).

**UAE courts and incoming foreign documents**: UAE courts require foreign documents to be apostilled (if from a signatory state) or consularly legalized (if from a non-signatory state). Translation into Arabic by a certified translator is also required.

### DIFC / ADGM

**DIFC Courts and ADGM Courts** operate their own notarial regimes within their free zones. Documents executed before a DIFC or ADGM notary are treated as duly authenticated within those free zones. For use outside the free zones (including in onshore UAE courts), the document may require additional MOFA authentication.

**Incoming notarial chains**: DIFC and ADGM courts generally recognize incoming notarial chains from signatory states (Apostille sufficient) and from non-signatory states (consular legalization chain sufficient). Confirm specific requirements with the court registry for high-stakes filings.

## Common document types and their requirements

| Document type | Typical requirement |
|---|---|
| Power of Attorney for use abroad | Notarize + Apostille/legalize |
| Corporate board resolution for foreign use | Notarize + Apostille/legalize + sometimes Chamber of Commerce |
| Certificate of incorporation for foreign registration | Apostille/legalize + certified translation |
| Marriage/divorce certificate | Apostille/legalize + sworn translation |
| Personal status documents (birth, nationality) | Apostille/legalize + sworn translation |
| Court judgment for foreign enforcement | Apostille/legalize (for recognition proceedings) |
| Real estate transfer instruments | Notarize per local land registry requirements |

## Validity periods

Some apostilles and legalizations carry expiry dates — typically 3 to 12 months. The destination authority may reject a document if the apostille or legalization has expired.

- **Rule**: verify the validity period with the issuing authority at the time of authentication, and plan the transaction timeline accordingly.
- **Do not authenticate too early**: if a deal has a 6-month closing timeline and the apostille expires in 3 months, re-authentication will be needed.

## Sworn translation

Authentication of the document's signature or provenance does not authenticate the translation. Where a certified or sworn translation is required alongside the notarized original, both must be submitted together. See [[heuristic-translation-certified-vs-sworn]] for translation authority levels.
