# Draft — Cease and Desist Letter

## When to use this

Use this skill to draft a cease-and-desist letter when a party needs to:
- Stop ongoing intellectual property infringement (trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret).
- Halt defamatory, libelous, or slanderous statements.
- Require cessation of a continuing contract breach.
- Stop harassment or unlawful conduct.
- Warn against unfair competition or passing off.

A C&D letter is usually the first formal legal step before litigation or arbitration. It creates a record that the infringer had notice (relevant to damages, especially in IP cases), provides an opportunity for voluntary compliance (avoiding cost and delay), and may preserve negotiating leverage for a settlement.

**Note**: A C&D letter is not a guarantee of rights — it is a demand. The letter may become evidence in subsequent proceedings, so tone and accuracy matter.

## Tone guidance

A C&D letter walks a line:
- **Firm**: the demands must be unambiguous; do not hedge the central ask.
- **Professional**: aggressive or abusive language weakens the letter's credibility if it becomes evidence and may expose the sender to counterclaims.
- **Accurate**: do not overstate the strength of the rights or the extent of the infringement. Courts and opposing counsel will scrutinize the letter; exaggerations undermine credibility.
- **Without prejudice** marker (where applicable): use "Without Prejudice" on letters that include settlement offers or admissions; absent a settlement offer, the letter can be marked "Private and Confidential" but need not be "Without Prejudice."

## IP-specific notes

### Trademark infringement
- State the registration number, jurisdiction, and classes of goods/services.
- Note the likelihood-of-confusion basis if the marks are not identical.
- For domain names: consider UDRP (WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center) as a parallel fast-track remedy.
- Attach the trademark certificate as an exhibit.

### Copyright infringement
- Copyright subsists automatically in most jurisdictions (no registration required).
- In jurisdictions with registration (US, KSA): state the registration number.
- Specify the exact copyrighted work(s) and where the infringing copy is found.
- For online infringement: see [[draft-takedown-dmca]] for the DMCA notice procedure (US platforms).

### Patent infringement
- **Caution**: incorrect patent infringement assertions can expose the sender to a declaratory judgment action (in the US) or antitrust/unfair competition claims.
- Do not send a patent C&D without a freedom-to-operate opinion or strong professional review.
- State the patent number, jurisdiction, and the specific claims arguably infringed.
- A "notice of infringement" stops the infringer from claiming innocent infringement damages.

### Trade secret misappropriation
- Do not describe the trade secret in detail in the letter (that would disclose it further).
- Identify it by category: "our client's proprietary customer database / algorithm / manufacturing process."
- Reference the confidentiality agreement if one was in place.

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE onshore
- C&D letters are common pre-litigation steps; courts expect them.
- For trademark infringement: UAE Federal Law on Industrial Property (Decree-Law 36/2021) — note trademark registration with Ministry of Economy.
- For copyright: UAE Federal Law on Intellectual Property (Federal Law 7/2002 as amended).
- C&D letter followed by filing a complaint with the IP Section of the Ministry of Economy is an administrative route.

### DIFC / ADGM
- English common-law principles; C&D letters follow UK practice.
- Interim injunctions (search orders, freezing orders) available from DIFC/ADGM Courts on short notice.

### KSA
- IP enforcement: Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property (SAIP).
- C&D letter sends a notice; follow with a complaint to SAIP or before the Commercial Court.
- Defamation claims are taken seriously; statements on social media can be criminal under Cybercrime Law.

### Lebanon
- IP: Intellectual Property Law (Law 75/1999); trademark registration with Ministry of Economy and Trade.
- Defamation: Criminal Code provisions; civil claim under Civil Code.

### US
- Copyright: DMCA takedown notice for online platforms is often faster than a C&D to the infringer.
- Patent: be aware of Inter Partes Review (IPR) and declaratory judgment risks before sending.
- Defamation: state law governs; truth is an absolute defense; opinion generally protected.

## Common mistakes

- **Vague demands**: "stop your infringing activities" is not a demand — specify exactly what must stop, what must be delivered, and by when.
- **Wrong legal basis**: asserting copyright infringement when what exists is a breach-of-contract claim (or vice versa) misleads the recipient and weakens the letter.
- **No evidence exhibits**: a C&D without supporting evidence is easily ignored.
- **Unreasonable deadline**: 2-3 days is typically unreasonable for a C&D response; 10-21 days is standard; enough time to compel compliance but short enough to maintain urgency.
- **Sending to the wrong person**: ensure the letter reaches the actual decision-maker at the infringing entity; registered agent addresses alone are insufficient.
