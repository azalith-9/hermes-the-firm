# Knowledge Pack — UAE Tax Law

## Scope

This pack covers the UAE federal tax framework as of 2026. The UAE introduced federal corporate income tax in 2023 (a historic shift), operates VAT at 5% since 2018, and in 2025 began applying a Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (DMTT) for large multinationals under the OECD Pillar Two framework. Despite these additions, the UAE remains a low-tax jurisdiction. Verify current FTA (Federal Tax Authority) guidance before advising on any specific position.

---

## Governing Authority

**Federal Tax Authority (FTA)** — administers Corporate Tax, VAT, and Excise Tax. Issues decisions, public clarifications, and binding private rulings (advance pricing arrangements available for CT).

---

## Corporate Tax (CT)

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Legal basis | Federal Decree-Law 47/2022 (CT Law), effective for tax periods starting on or after 1 June 2023 |
| Standard rate | 9% on taxable income above AED 375,000 |
| Small business relief | 0% effective rate for businesses with revenue ≤ AED 3 million (Small Business Relief; election available until 31 December 2026 per Ministerial Decision 73/2023) |
| Zero bracket | First AED 375,000 of taxable income: 0% |
| Multinational top-up (DMTT) | 15% for UAE-resident entities of MNE groups with consolidated global revenue ≥ €750 million; effective for periods starting on or after 1 January 2025 |

### Taxable persons

- UAE-resident juridical persons (mainland and free zone companies, branches of foreign companies)
- Non-resident juridical persons with UAE permanent establishment or UAE-source income
- Natural persons carrying on business in the UAE (if annual business income > AED 1 million)

### Exempt persons

- UAE federal and emirate governments and their wholly owned entities
- Qualifying Public Benefit Entities
- Qualifying Investment Funds (QIF) — subject to conditions
- Pension and social security funds

---

## Qualifying Free Zone Persons (QFZP)

Free zones retain 0% tax on qualifying income subject to strict conditions:

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Qualifying income | Must derive from activities listed in Ministerial Decision 265/2023 (financial services, shipping, logistics, holding, manufacturing, etc.) |
| Adequate substance | Must have sufficient substance in the free zone (employees, assets, operations) |
| Related-party transactions | Domestic-mainland related-party income may be non-qualifying |
| Transfer pricing | All related-party transactions subject to arm's-length rules |
| Excluded income | Certain income (e.g., from mainland UAE real estate) is automatically non-qualifying |

**Key trap:** Free zone companies transacting with mainland-UAE related parties risk tainting their QFZP status. Even a small volume of non-qualifying income can subject the entire entity to 9% on all income in some interpretations — seek specific FTA guidance.

---

## Value Added Tax (VAT)

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Legal basis | Federal Decree-Law 8/2017 and Executive Regulation (as amended) |
| Standard rate | 5% |
| Mandatory registration | Annual taxable supplies or imports ≥ AED 375,000 |
| Voluntary registration | ≥ AED 187,500 |
| Filing | Quarterly (default); monthly for large taxpayers |
| Zero-rated supplies | Exports of goods and services, international passenger/freight transport, certain healthcare, certain education, first supply of residential real estate, precious metals for investment |
| Exempt supplies | Bare land, subsequent supplies of residential real estate, local passenger transport, certain financial services |

**Designated zones (free zones for VAT):** Goods moving between designated zones are outside UAE for VAT purposes (not an import/export). A common planning tool for goods businesses but requires compliance with FTA designated-zone rules.

---

## Excise Tax

| Product | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars) | 100% |
| Electronic smoking devices and tools | 100% |
| Energy drinks | 100% |
| Sweetened beverages (carbonated) | 50% |
| Carbonated water / drinks | 50% |

Excise is levied on the first supply in the UAE (import or local production). Registration and monthly filing required for excisable goods.

---

## Personal Income Tax

- **None.** The UAE imposes no individual income tax.
- No capital gains tax on personal investments in securities, real estate, or business interests held personally.
- Real estate gains inside a company (CT-registered) may constitute taxable corporate income.

---

## Withholding Tax

The UAE imposes no withholding tax on outbound payments under the CT Law as enacted. This favourable position applies to:
- Dividends to foreign shareholders
- Interest payments to foreign lenders
- Royalties to foreign IP owners
- Service fees to non-resident service providers

**DTT interaction:** Even without domestic WHT, the UAE's extensive treaty network (80+ treaties) may benefit recipients in treaty-partner jurisdictions in terms of the other state's domestic tax treatment of UAE-source income.

---

## Transfer Pricing

- Arm's-length principle applies to all transactions between "Related Parties" (defined broadly under the CT Law to include 50%+ common ownership and other control tests)
- Documentation aligned with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines:
  - **Master File** and **Local File** for taxpayers above AED 200 million in revenue (or as specified by Ministerial Decision)
  - **Disclosure Form** for related-party transactions — filed with CT return for all taxpayers with related-party transactions
  - **Country-by-Country Report (CbCR):** for UAE Ultimate Parent entities of groups with consolidated revenue ≥ AED 3.15 billion; filed within 12 months of fiscal year-end
- Connected-person transactions (individuals and their related entities) also subject to arm's-length requirement

---

## DIFC and ADGM

Both the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) are now subject to UAE federal corporate tax. Previously they operated under a 50-year tax-holiday guarantee from their founding legislation. The CT Law supersedes those guarantees for income tax purposes.

**Residual DIFC/ADGM advantages:**
- Common law courts and English-language legislation (not a tax advantage, but critical for deal structuring)
- Specific fund, investment manager, and family office exemptions may still reduce effective CT rate
- ADGM and DIFC retain their own company law, which does not affect federal CT applicability

---

## Family Offices and Investment Funds

- **Qualifying Investment Fund (QIF):** Exempt from CT if it meets ownership diversification, regulatory registration, and arm's-length management requirements. Fund investors taxed on their share of fund income when distributed, not at fund level.
- **Family Foundations:** Ministerial guidance allows certain family foundations to elect transparent treatment (income taxed in hands of founders/beneficiaries rather than foundation itself).
- **Single Family Offices:** Specific guidance available; structure-dependent.

---

## Anti-Avoidance

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) | FTA may disregard or recharacterise arrangements whose primary purpose is obtaining a CT advantage not intended by the CT Law |
| Specific anti-avoidance rules | Target dividend-stripping, hybrid mismatch arrangements, and certain related-party payment structures |
| Interest limitation rule | Net interest expenditure deduction capped at 30% of EBITDA (with a de minimis threshold of AED 12 million) |
| CFC rules | Controlled Foreign Company provisions apply to UAE-resident persons holding interests in foreign entities |

---

## Permanent Establishment (PE)

- The CT Law adopts a PE concept for non-resident persons deriving UAE-source income.
- Fixed-place PE: a fixed place of business in the UAE (office, factory, warehouse).
- Deemed PE: an agent habitually concluding contracts on behalf of the non-resident, or activities in the UAE exceeding time thresholds specified in applicable DTTs.
- **Key planning point:** Non-residents relying on UAE agents (sales agents, distributors) must assess PE risk carefully; the CT Law's deemed PE provision is broader than the pre-2023 position.

## Caveats & Currency

UAE tax law post-2023 is evolving rapidly. The FTA issues Cabinet Decisions, Ministerial Decisions, and Public Clarifications that supplement and sometimes amend the Decree-Law on short notice. Key areas of current flux:
- QFZP qualifying activities list (Ministerial Decision 265/2023 — subject to revision)
- DMTT implementing regulations (2025)
- Interest limitation safe harbours
- Specific guidance on family foundations and QIFs

Always verify the current FTA website and seek a private ruling for novel or high-value positions. This pack does not constitute tax advice.
