# Inst — KSA Ministry of Justice Integration

## Purpose

Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Justice (وزارة العدل) has built one of the Gulf's most comprehensive legal digitalization ecosystems, centered on the **Najiz** platform. This institutional skill bridges Louis to MOJ digital services: court case status lookups, e-filing guidance, official document templates, notarial services, and the MOJ's public-facing legal information programs.

---

## When to use this

- A user wants to check the status of a case before Saudi courts (commercial, personal status, labor, administrative)
- A practitioner needs to file documents electronically through Najiz or the e-court system
- A user requests an official Saudi legal document template (power of attorney, affidavit, notarized statement)
- A lawyer's registration or license status with the Saudi MOJ needs verification
- A user asks about Saudi court hierarchy, competence, or procedure
- A matter requires authentication/apostille of a Saudi document for use abroad

## Integration workflow

### Case status lookup
1. Accept: case number + court identifier, or party name + NIN (National Identification Number)
2. Query Najiz API (or web scrape with appropriate rate limiting)
3. Return: case title, court, judge (if public), status (pending / decided / appealed), next hearing date
4. Flag: if case is in enforcement phase or has active travel ban associated

### E-filing guidance
1. Identify: court, case type, pleading type
2. Retrieve: Najiz submission checklist for that filing type
3. Generate: structured document with correct Arabic headings per MOJ template
4. Checklist: authentication requirements, fee payment (SADAD reference), document format (PDF/A)
5. Confirm: submission acknowledgment tracking number

### Document templates
MOJ publishes standard templates for:
- Wakala (power of attorney) — general and special
- Affidavits (Shihada) — for witnesses and parties
- Commercial agency agreements (form)
- Waiver letters (Ibra)
- Rental dispute declarations

Louis generates drafts using MOJ-standard Arabic headings; user must sign and notarize before official use.

## Key legal framework

| Instrument | Subject |
|---|---|
| Royal Decree No. M/38 of 2001 (as amended) | Legal Profession Law — lawyer licensing |
| Law of Civil Procedure (Royal Decree No. M/1 of 2021) | Courts of general jurisdiction procedure |
| Commercial Courts Law (Royal Decree No. M/93 of 2020) | Commercial disputes |
| Labor Law (Royal Decree No. M/51 of 2005, as amended) | Employment disputes — Labor Courts jurisdiction |
| Enforcement Law (Royal Decree No. M/53 of 2012) | Execution of judgments |
| Electronic Transactions Law (Royal Decree No. M/18 of 2007) | E-signatures, e-filing validity |

## Practical traps

- **Arabic-only filings**: Saudi courts require Arabic-language pleadings. Translated documents must be certified by a MOJ-licensed translator.
- **Najiz system availability**: scheduled maintenance windows (typically Friday nights KSA time) affect filing deadlines — build in buffer before deadline days.
- **Travel bans**: Saudi courts can impose travel bans on defendants — check before advising clients on travel.
- **Foreign judgment enforcement**: Saudi courts will enforce foreign judgments only through treaty (limited) or reciprocity — New York Convention applies for arbitral awards.
- **Islamic law overlay**: personal status matters, inheritance, and certain commercial disputes may be decided partly under Sharia principles even in "commercial" courts.
