# Embedded Finance Partnership Agreement

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting the commercial and regulatory framework agreement for an embedded finance arrangement — where a licensed financial institution (the FinTech or "program manager") provides regulated financial services (banking, lending, payments, e-money, insurance) through a non-financial platform's application. The end customer interacts with the platform's branded experience; the financial product is powered by the FinTech's license and infrastructure.

Typical structures:
- E-commerce platform offering buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) powered by a licensed lender
- Ride-hailing or food-delivery app offering a digital wallet powered by an e-money institution
- B2B SaaS platform offering integrated expense management and corporate cards via a bank API
- Digital marketplace offering merchant acquiring services through a licensed acquirer

The agreement must address both commercial terms and the regulatory dimension: in most jurisdictions, the FinTech is the regulated entity and the platform acts as its distribution partner; the allocation of regulatory obligations must be explicit.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| FinTech / licensed entity name, license type, and jurisdiction | Determines what regulated services can be offered and which regime applies | Ask |
| Platform name and business description | Defines the distribution channel | Ask |
| Financial services to be embedded (banking, lending, wallet, cards, insurance) | Each service type has different regulatory requirements | Ask |
| Target customer segment (retail consumer, SME, enterprise) | Affects KYC/CDD obligations, consumer protection rules | Ask |
| Revenue model | Revenue share, margin on float, fee per transaction — must be agreed | Ask |
| Governing law and dispute resolution | Must be clear for a regulated contract | Ask |

## Optional inputs

- Exclusivity (can the platform work with other FinTech partners for competing services?)
- White-label branding arrangements (whose brand on the product?)
- Data ownership and portability on termination
- Regulatory change mechanism (what happens if the FinTech's license is revoked or conditions change?)
- Customer migration plan on termination

## Document structure

### 1. Parties and Definitions

Define key terms precisely:
- **FinTech Services**: the specific regulated financial products and APIs being provided
- **Platform Application**: the non-financial software through which services are embedded
- **End Customers**: the users who access the financial services through the Platform
- **Transaction**: each use of the FinTech Services by an End Customer
- **Program Manager** (optional): if the FinTech delegates day-to-day program operations to the Platform

### 2. Scope of Services

- Description of each embedded financial service (wallet, card issuance, lending, payment initiation, etc.)
- API specifications: reference to API documentation; the FinTech's SLA obligations for API availability (99.9% uptime typical)
- Geographic scope of services
- Customer segment restrictions (retail only? SME? licensed activities only in specified jurisdictions)

### 3. Regulatory Responsibilities

This is the most critical section from a compliance perspective:

**FinTech's obligations**:
- Maintain the license(s) required to offer the financial services
- Bear primary responsibility for AML/KYC compliance for End Customers it onboards
- File STRs with the applicable Financial Intelligence Unit
- Implement sanctions screening
- Maintain adequate capital and safeguarding obligations for customer funds
- Report to the regulator as required; provide the Platform with compliance guidance

**Platform's obligations**:
- Only present the FinTech's services as authorized by this agreement
- Not make representations about the financial services that misstate the FinTech's regulatory status
- Implement the KYC/CDD front-end as specified by the FinTech (document collection, liveness checks, etc.)
- Notify the FinTech immediately of any actual or suspected fraud, AML events, or regulatory enquiries
- Maintain IT security standards as specified
- Comply with applicable consumer protection and data protection laws in its own right

**Shared responsibilities** (to be allocated explicitly):
- Customer complaints handling: first line (Platform or FinTech?); escalation path
- Regulatory enquiries: who responds to the regulator when the enquiry touches both parties?
- Financial promotions / marketing: who signs off on marketing materials referencing the financial product?

### 4. Customer Ownership and Data

- **Customer relationship**: Who is the customer's principal counterparty for the financial product? In a regulated sense, the FinTech is the regulated entity and owns the regulatory relationship.
- **Data ownership**: End Customer personal and transaction data — who owns it? Common position: FinTech owns data required for regulatory compliance; Platform owns commercial relationship data; both have rights in aggregate analytics.
- **Data sharing**: Define what data flows between the parties; GDPR / UAE PDPL / KSA PDPL compliance for cross-border data flows.
- **Post-termination data**: Customer records must be retained by the FinTech for regulatory purposes (typically 5–10 years); customer access to their data.

### 5. Revenue Sharing

- **Model 1 — Interchange / fee split**: The FinTech collects interchange or service fees; splits a percentage with the Platform based on transaction volume
- **Model 2 — Gross margin share**: Platform charges end customers; remits a percentage to the FinTech for the regulated service
- **Model 3 — Platform fee**: Platform pays the FinTech a per-user or per-transaction API fee; Platform retains all revenue from end customers
- Include a payment schedule, invoice process, and dispute resolution for revenue calculations
- Specify withholding tax allocation and VAT treatment

### 6. Technology and API

- API terms: reference to separate API documentation and developer agreement
- Change management: FinTech cannot change API in a way that breaks Platform integration without [90]-day notice and migration support
- Downtime: SLA, service credits for downtime exceeding threshold
- Security standards: PCI-DSS compliance (if card data involved); penetration testing obligations; incident reporting timeline (typically 24–72 hours for security incidents)

### 7. Liability and Indemnification

- **FinTech indemnifies Platform** for: losses caused by FinTech's negligence, license failure, or regulatory breach
- **Platform indemnifies FinTech** for: losses caused by Platform's misrepresentation of the financial products, Platform-side fraud, or Platform's data protection breach
- **Consequential loss exclusion**: neither party liable for lost profits, lost data, or indirect losses (subject to carve-outs for gross negligence and willful misconduct)
- **Cap on liability**: typically [12 months' aggregate fees] per incident

### 8. Term and Termination

- Initial term (commonly 2–3 years with auto-renewal)
- Termination for convenience: [90–180] days' notice (longer than a typical SaaS contract because of the operational complexity of migrating end customers)
- Termination for cause: material breach (with [30]-day cure period); insolvency; license revocation
- Consequences of termination: wind-down period; customer transition obligations; data portability; run-off for existing customer balances

## Jurisdictional notes

| Jurisdiction | Regulatory framework for embedded finance | Key considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **UAE (CBUAE)** | Retail Payment Services and Card Schemes Regulation; stored value facility rules | FinTech must hold a licensed payment service provider status; Platforms acting as distribution agents may need registration as "payment facilitators" under CBUAE rules |
| **DIFC (DFSA)** | DFSA Rulebook; Arranging or Providing Money Services authorization required | DFSA distinguishes between a licensed firm (FinTech) and its appointed representatives; Platform may act as appointed representative if properly documented |
| **ADGM (FSRA)** | FSRA Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 | Similar to DIFC; FSRA RegLab sandbox available for novel embedded finance models |
| **KSA (SAMA)** | Payment Services Provider Regulations | SAMA requires SAMA-licensed entity to be the primary service provider; Platform must not perform any licensed activity without SAMA approval |
| **UK (FCA)** | E-Money Regulations 2011; Payment Services Regulations 2017 | Platform acting as distributor of e-money may need to be an appointed representative of the FinTech or hold its own FCA authorization; financial promotion rules strictly apply |
| **EU (EMD2 / PSD2)** | Second E-Money Directive (EMD2); Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) | Platform may act as agent of the EMI; agent registration required with NCA; GDPR governs data sharing |

## Common mistakes

- **Treating the platform as merely a technology provider**: Regulators look through the structure; if the Platform is performing regulated activities (onboarding, marketing, holding funds), it may need its own license.
- **Ambiguous regulatory responsibility allocation**: When a regulator enquires about an AML failure and both parties point to each other, the FinTech — as the licensed entity — bears primary liability regardless of contract.
- **No customer migration plan**: When the partnership terminates, End Customers with funds in the Platform's wallet need a migration path; failure to address this creates stranded customer risk and regulatory exposure.
- **Financial promotions without approval**: In UK, EU, UAE, and KSA, any communication that promotes a financial product must be approved by the licensed entity; the Platform's marketing team cannot draft and publish unapproved financial promotions.
- **Missing PCI-DSS obligations**: If card data is processed through the Platform's application, PCI-DSS compliance obligations must be allocated explicitly; the risk of a card data breach is significant.
