# Employee Handbook

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting a new employee handbook, updating an existing one, or localizing a global handbook for a specific jurisdiction. The handbook is the primary HR compliance document for companies operating across MENA: it must reflect the employer's obligations under mandatory labour law, while also setting out the internal culture and operating rules the company wants to maintain.

Typical triggers:
- Company establishing its first local operations in UAE, KSA, Lebanon, or Egypt
- Global company localizing its group handbook for a MENA entity
- HR team modernizing outdated policies following regulatory changes
- Preparing for a Ministry of Labour audit or corporate investor due diligence

## Required inputs

| Industry / sector | Affects health & safety requirements, working hours, Saudization/Emiratization | Ask |
| Workforce composition | Local nationals vs. expatriates; full-time vs. contractors; manual vs. office workers | Ask |
| Key HR policies already established | To avoid contradicting existing policies | Ask |

## Jurisdictional notes

### Non-compete enforceability

| Jurisdiction | Enforceability | Key limit |
|---|---|---|
| **UAE** | Enforceable if reasonable in scope, geography, and duration | Maximum 2 years; limited to activities that compete; employee must have been exposed to trade secrets or key clients |
| **KSA** | Enforceable but scrutinized; limited application in practice | Courts apply "reasonableness" standard |
| **Lebanon** | Enforceable in principle under Lebanese Code of Obligations and Contracts | Must be reasonable; courts will reduce scope if too broad |
| **Egypt** | Enforceable if restricted in scope and duration | Labour courts apply a reasonableness standard; excessive restrictions not enforced |
| **DIFC** | Common-law standard; enforceable if protects legitimate business interest | Garden leave as an alternative; post-termination restrictions >12 months are harder to enforce |

### Arabic language requirements

- **UAE**: The Arabic version of employment documents is the official version if there is a conflict (Ministry of Labour requirements); bilingual handbooks should include Arabic
- **KSA**: All employment contracts must be in Arabic; handbook should have Arabic version
- **Lebanon**: French and Arabic are both official languages; French is commonly used in commercial settings
- **Egypt**: Arabic is the official language; Arabic version governs

## Common mistakes

- **Copy-paste from a global handbook**: US-style "at-will" employment, FMLA references, or 401(k) provisions have no place in MENA employee handbooks and signal to employees that the employer doesn't know the local law.
- **Missing gratuity calculation**: The end-of-service gratuity section must include the correct statutory formula for the jurisdiction; errors create significant financial liability.
- **Wrong leave entitlements**: Giving less than the statutory minimum annual leave in any MENA jurisdiction violates mandatory labour law; audit the handbook against each jurisdiction's statute.
- **No Arabic version**: In UAE and KSA, the absence of an Arabic handbook (or Arabic employment contract) can be used by employees in labour court to argue the English version does not bind them.
- **Treating the handbook as legally binding**: In some jurisdictions, the handbook is incorporated into the employment contract by reference; in others it is not. Clarify its legal status explicitly.
