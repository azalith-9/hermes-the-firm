# Data Retention Policy

A Data Retention Policy operationalises the data minimisation and storage limitation principles of every major data protection framework. It answers the question every lawyer and compliance officer faces: "How long can we keep this?" — and the equally important question that most organisations neglect: "How do we securely delete it when we no longer need it?"

## When to use this

- A company is implementing a data protection compliance program and needs a formal policy.
- A regulatory review or ISO 27001 / SOC 2 audit requires evidence of a documented retention policy.
- The company is responding to a data subject erasure request and needs to verify whether the applicable retention period has expired.
- Litigation has been filed or is anticipated and the company needs to implement a litigation hold (and stop the normal retention schedule for relevant data).
- The company is migrating to a new data platform and needs to know what data to migrate vs. what to delete first.
- A data mapping / ROPA (Records of Processing Activities) exercise has revealed data that has been retained without a documented basis.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|---|---|---|
| Company name and jurisdiction(s) of operation | Determines applicable legal retention requirements | Ask the user |
| Categories of data processed | Retention periods vary by data type; policy must cover all categories | Ask the user to provide a data inventory or describe their main data categories |
| Industry sector | Some sectors have mandatory minimum retention periods (financial services, healthcare, employment) | Ask the user |
| Whether the company holds employee data | Employment law adds retention obligations beyond data protection law | Ask the user |
| Whether the company is subject to GDPR and/or MENA data protection laws | Determines which frameworks apply | Ask the user |

## Optional inputs

- Whether the policy will be shared with data subjects (affects language calibration).
- Whether the company uses third-party document management or DMS systems.
- Whether the company has an existing litigation hold process that the policy should integrate with.
- Whether the company's auditors have specified any record retention minimums.

## Policy structure

### 1. Purpose and scope
- The policy applies to all personal and business data held by the company in any format (paper and electronic).
- Purpose: to comply with applicable data protection law, meet regulatory and legal obligations, and protect the company from retaining data beyond the period for which there is a valid justification.
- Scope: all employees, contractors, and third parties who hold company data.

### 2. Governing principles

**2.1 Storage limitation (data protection law)**
Data must not be kept longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. This is a mandatory principle under:
- GDPR Art. 5(1)(e): storage limitation principle
- UAE PDPL: equivalent principle (Art. 15 — data must not be retained after the purpose is achieved)
- DIFC DP Law / ADGM DP Regs: storage limitation as a data processing principle
- KSA PDPL: Art. 10 — personal data must be destroyed or anonymised when no longer needed for the stated purpose

**2.2 Legal retention minimums**
Certain data must be retained for minimum periods specified by law — the policy cannot delete data earlier than the legal minimum even if the processing purpose has ended. See the Retention Schedule below.

**2.3 Balancing retention and minimisation**
When a mandatory minimum and a data minimisation obligation conflict, retain for the mandatory minimum and delete immediately upon expiry.

### 3. Retention schedule

Present as a table covering all major data categories. Tailor to the company's specific data inventory.

| Data category | Specific data types | Minimum retention period | Legal basis for minimum | Maximum retention | Deletion method |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Employee records** | Employment contracts, payroll, performance reviews, disciplinary records | 5–7 years after end of employment (varies by jurisdiction) | Employment law; social insurance law; tax law | 7 years post-employment | Secure deletion per Section 5 |
| **Customer/client records** | Identity documents, KYC files, correspondence | 5 years from end of relationship (AML); longer if pending proceedings | AML law (UAE, KSA, LB, EG, GCC); FATF Rec. 11 | 10 years if required by AML law | Secure deletion per Section 5 |
| **Financial and accounting records** | Invoices, contracts, bank records, tax records | 5–10 years depending on jurisdiction | UAE: 5 years (Commercial Transactions Law); KSA: 10 years (Commercial Court Law); LB: 10 years (Commercial Code); EG: 5 years (Tax Law); GDPR/EU: 10 years; UK: 6 years | Maximum legal period + 1 year | Secure deletion per Section 5 |
| **Legal records** | Contracts, litigation files, legal opinions | Until expiry of the applicable limitation period + 2 years | Limitation law (UAE Civil Code: 15 years general; KSA: 5 years; LB: 10 years; DIFC: 6 years; UK: 6 years) | Limitation period + 2 years | Secure deletion per Section 5 |
| **Health / medical records (employees)** | Medical certificates, occupational health reports | 10 years from last entry (or longer if occupational exposure involved) | Occupational health law; employment law | 10 years | Secure deletion with higher assurance level |
| **Marketing data** | Email lists, campaign data, analytics | Until consent is withdrawn or purpose ends; maximum 3 years from last interaction without refresh of consent | GDPR / UAE PDPL / KSA PDPL consent principles | 3 years unless consent renewed | Secure deletion per Section 5 |
| **Website / app logs and analytics** | Server logs, access logs, analytics data | As required for security purposes (typically 90 days); anonymised analytics may be retained longer | Legitimate interests (security); privacy law (minimisation) | 12 months (anonymised analytics: indefinitely) | Log deletion; anonymisation |
| **CCTV / surveillance footage** | Video footage from premises | 30–90 days unless required for incident | UAE CCTV regulations; employee privacy obligations | 90 days (or until resolution of any incident captured) | Overwrite / secure deletion |
| **Communications records** | Emails, chat logs, call recordings | Varies: financial services requires longer retention; general commercial = 3 years | Regulatory requirements; limitation periods | 7 years for regulated entities; 3 years for non-regulated | Secure deletion per Section 5 |

**MENA retention minimums:**

| Jurisdiction | Key mandatory minimums |
|---|---|
| UAE | Commercial records: 5 years (UAE Commercial Transactions Law); AML records: 5 years (AML Law); VAT records: 5 years (VAT Law) |
| KSA | Commercial records: 10 years; ZATCA tax records: 10 years; AML records: 10 years (AML Law) |
| Lebanon | Commercial records: 10 years (Code of Commerce); AML records: 5 years (Law No. 318 of 2001) |
| Egypt | Commercial records: 5 years (Tax Law); AML records: 5 years (AML Law No. 80 of 2002) |
| DIFC | Regulated entity records: as specified in DFSA Rulebook; general commercial: 6 years (DIFC Contract Law limitation period) |
| ADGM | Equivalent to DIFC; FSRA Rulebook specifies regulated entity minimums |

### 4. Review and categorisation responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Data Protection Officer / Privacy Lead | Maintain and update the Retention Schedule; advise on legal requirements; approve exceptions |
| IT / Systems | Implement technical controls to enforce retention periods; manage secure deletion tools |
| HR | Manage employee data retention; liaise with DPO on employment law minimums |
| Finance / Accounting | Manage financial records in accordance with tax and accounting retention requirements |
| Legal / Compliance | Manage legal files; issue litigation holds; advise on limitation periods |
| All employees | Follow the policy; report data holdings not covered by the schedule; not delete data subject to a litigation hold |

### 5. Secure deletion procedures

**5.1 Electronic data:**
- Standard method: secure overwriting using NIST 800-88 compliant tools (for non-SSD media) or cryptographic erasure (for encrypted media).
- SSD/flash storage: ATA Secure Erase command or physical destruction.
- Cloud data: use the cloud provider's compliant deletion procedure (per DPA terms); obtain written confirmation of deletion.
- Backup media: after the backup retention period expires, securely destroy or overwrite.

**5.2 Paper records:**
- Cross-cut shredding (DIN 66399 security level P-4 or above) or contracted confidential waste destruction service.
- For highly sensitive data: strip-cut shredding (P-5/P-6) or incineration.
- Obtain destruction certificate for records of sensitive data.

**5.3 Confirmation of deletion:**
For all high-value or special-category data deletion, maintain a deletion log confirming: what was deleted, when, by whom, and by what method.

### 6. Litigation hold (legal hold)

When litigation is filed, threatened, or reasonably anticipated, the normal retention schedule is suspended for all data that is potentially relevant:
- The Legal team issues a Litigation Hold Notice to all custodians of relevant data.
- The notice overrides any automated deletion or scheduled destruction.
- All custodians must preserve relevant data until the hold is lifted.
- Failure to preserve relevant data after a hold is issued can result in sanctions in litigation (adverse inference, cost orders, striking out of claims).
- When litigation concludes, the Legal team issues a hold release and the normal schedule resumes.

### 7. Policy review and exceptions
- This policy is reviewed annually by the DPO.
- Requests for exceptions (extending retention beyond the scheduled period or deleting before the minimum) must be approved by the DPO in writing and documented.
- Any change to applicable law that affects retention periods must be reflected in the Retention Schedule within 30 days of the change taking effect.

## Common mistakes

- A Retention Schedule that specifies periods but does not identify who is responsible for enforcing deletion.
- No secure deletion procedure — deleting a file from a computer does not delete the data; the policy must specify the method.
- Not including AML-mandated retention periods — regulatory minimum retention is often longer than the data minimisation preference.
- Forgetting backup media — data deleted from primary systems may persist in backups for years.
- No litigation hold procedure — the most expensive data retention failure is not keeping data that should have been deleted, but deleting data that should have been preserved for litigation.
