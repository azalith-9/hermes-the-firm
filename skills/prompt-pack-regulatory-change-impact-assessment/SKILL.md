# Regulatory Change Impact Assessment

## When to use this

Use this skill when:
- A regulator (CBUAE, SCA, ADGM FSRA, DFSA, SAMA, CMA-SA, FRA Egypt) issues a new law, regulation, circular, or implementing regulation that affects a client's business.
- A law has been amended (e.g., UAE Federal Decree-Law on Commercial Companies, Saudi Companies Law) and the client needs to know which current practices must change.
- An industry is entering new regulatory territory (e.g., UAE Virtual Asset Regulation, Saudi fintech sandbox exit, DIFC new employment law) and the client needs a gap analysis before the compliance deadline.
- A cross-border business is impacted by regulatory change in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously (e.g., GCC VAT harmonization, FATF grey-list impacts, new cross-border data flow restrictions).

**Do not use** this skill as a substitute for a full legal opinion — it produces a structured memo; a qualified lawyer must verify the analysis against the actual text of the new regulation.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| **Name/reference of the new regulation or amendment** | Anchors the entire analysis; without it, output is generic | Ask — do not guess the instrument |
| **Description of the company/industry** | Determines which provisions apply and what operations are affected | Ask: "What does the company do, and where does it operate?" |
| **Jurisdiction(s) of operation** | Regulations are territorial; a UAE company and a DIFC company face different rules even within the same city | Ask; default to UAE onshore if unclear |
| **Effective date of the regulation** | Sets the urgency and implementation timeline | Ask; if unknown, state "effective date TBD — verify" |
| **Existing compliance posture (if known)** | Enables a genuine gap analysis rather than a generic checklist | Optional but valuable |

## Optional inputs

- **Sector-specific licenses held** — e.g., FSRA Category 3C license, UAE payment services license, Saudi CMA brokerage license — determines which rules apply.
- **Prior impact assessments** — allows the output to build on existing work rather than starting from scratch.
- **Risk appetite of the client** — conservative clients may want a zero-tolerance gap list; commercial clients may want a prioritized list by materiality.

## Document structure (output memo)

1. **Executive summary** — 3–5 bullet points: what changed, why it matters to this client, and the top compliance priorities. Designed to be read by senior management without legal background.
2. **Regulatory change overview**
   - Name and reference of the regulation
   - Issuing authority
   - Effective date and phase-in periods
   - Official summary of intent
   - Where to find the full text
3. **Applicability analysis** — does this regulation apply to the client? Scope of application (entity type, activity, threshold, territorial nexus). Flag if applicability is uncertain — note the specific ambiguity.
4. **Affected operations inventory** — table mapping each operational area (customer onboarding, contract terms, reporting, data handling, product features, employment, tax) to the relevant new requirement.

   | Operational Area | Current Practice | New Requirement | Gap? |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | [e.g., KYC/AML process] | [describe] | [what the regulation requires] | Yes / No / Partial |

5. **Compliance gap analysis** — for each gap identified: severity (high/medium/low), probability of regulatory action if unaddressed, and remediation effort.
6. **Required policy and contract changes** — list of internal policies, standard contracts, customer terms, or employee agreements that need amendment. Note whether changes require regulatory pre-approval (e.g., some UAE licensed entities must submit revised policies to the regulator before implementation).
7. **Implementation timeline and priorities**
   - Must-do before effective date (hard deadline)
   - Should-do within 90 days of effective date
   - Nice-to-have / best-practice improvements
8. **Risk mitigation strategies** — for each high-severity gap: specific action, responsible function (legal, compliance, operations, IT), estimated effort, and escalation path if action cannot be completed in time.
9. **Open questions and legal uncertainties** — items where the regulation is ambiguous, implementing guidance has not been issued, or the firm's interpretation is uncertain. Flag for escalation to specialized counsel or direct regulatory inquiry.
10. **Next steps** — specific action items with owners and deadlines.

## Jurisdictional / practice notes

### UAE — onshore
- UAE regulatory change often comes with short implementation windows (sometimes 30–90 days from publication in the Official Gazette).
- Key regulators: CBUAE (banking, payments, insurance), SCA (capital markets), MOHRE (employment), UAE Data Office (data protection), VARA (virtual assets).
- Ministry of Economy notifications and ADNOC/SWF-related sector rules must be checked separately.
- Arabic text of regulations is authoritative; English translations may lag or differ.

### DIFC / ADGM
- DFSA (DIFC) and FSRA (ADGM) both have mature regulatory change consultation processes; responses to consultations can influence final rules.
- Both publish regulatory change calendars — subscribe to stay ahead.
- Changes to DFSA Rules (Rulebook modules) or ADGM Regulations are immediately binding on licensees.

### KSA
- SAMA, CMA, ZATCA (tax authority), and HRSD (employment) each issue regulations in their sectors.
- Arabic-language regulatory texts are controlling; always read the Arabic version.
- Some regulations require companies to appoint a Saudi compliance officer or maintain local records.

### Egypt
- FRA (Financial Regulatory Authority) and CBE (Central Bank of Egypt) regulate financial services.
- Egyptian law frequently issues ministerial decrees implementing framework laws; check implementing decrees, not just the primary law.

### GCC-wide
- GCC Unified VAT Agreement underpins each member state's VAT law; changes at the GCC level may cascade into national law.
- FATF membership and grey-listing status affects AML/CTF obligations across the region; monitor FATF mutual evaluation reports.

## Drafting standards

- Write the executive summary for a CFO or COO audience — no legal jargon.
- Use the gap table format; do not write a discursive narrative where a table would communicate faster.
- Label each gap by severity (High / Medium / Low) based on: (a) regulatory penalty exposure, (b) likelihood of regulatory scrutiny, (c) operational disruption if unaddressed.
- Cite the specific article or section of the new regulation for each requirement — do not paraphrase loosely.
- Do not invent article numbers — if you are not certain of the precise citation, write "[verify article reference]".
- Date the memo and note which version of the regulation was analyzed; regulatory texts can be amended post-publication.

## Common mistakes

- **Analyzing the wrong instrument.** Regulations are often amended by subsequent circulars; ensure you have the most current version including any implementing regulations and guidance notes.
- **Missing phase-in provisions.** Many MENA regulations have staggered effective dates by entity size or license type; confirm whether the client falls into the early or late cohort.
- **Treating a gap analysis as a compliance certificate.** The memo identifies gaps; it does not constitute a legal opinion that the company is compliant. Include a standard disclaimer.
- **Ignoring Arabic-language nuances.** For UAE and KSA regulations, key definitions in the Arabic text may differ subtly from the English translation; the Arabic version governs in case of conflict.
- **Failing to escalate ambiguity.** Regulators sometimes welcome no-action letter requests or informal guidance; the assessment should flag where a direct regulatory inquiry is warranted.
