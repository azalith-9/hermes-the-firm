description: Use when a law student needs a comprehensive course outline for exam preparation, bar revision, or self-study. Produces a structured topic hierarchy with black-letter rules, leading cases (1–3 per topic), common exam patterns, issue interactions, and memorization aids (mnemonics, comparison charts). Calibrated to specific law-school courses (Contracts, Torts, Civ Pro, Con Law, Crim Law, Evidence, Property, Corporate, and more) and to the applicable jurisdiction. Particularly strong for MENA civil-law courses (Lebanon, UAE, KSA, Egypt) and common-law courses (DIFC, UK, US).

### Leading cases / instruments
- [Case or statute 1] — [one-line significance]
- [Case or statute 2] — [one-line significance]
- [Case or statute 3 if applicable]

### Common exam patterns
- [Scenario type 1]: [what to spot + what to argue]
- [Scenario type 2]: ...

### Tested issue interactions
- This topic often appears with [Topic X] because [reason]

## Exam-pattern section — how to write it

For each topic, identify:

1. **The classic test scenario** — what fact pattern reliably tests this rule?
2. **The trap** — what do students commonly miss (hidden sub-issue, element they skip)?
3. **The counter-argument** — what's the strongest opposing argument?

Example (Contracts — Formation):

> **Classic test:** Offer + attempted acceptance by conduct + cross in the mail. Tests mailbox rule, mirror-image, and whether conduct constitutes acceptance.
>
> **Trap:** Students miss that the offer was revoked before acceptance — revocation timing matters.
>
> **Counter-argument:** Even if mailbox rule doesn't apply, conduct may create estoppel.

## Memorization aids

Where appropriate, include:

- **Acronyms**: IRAC, DEEDS (Duress, Error, Exclusions, Damages, Statute) etc.
- **Decision trees**: binary flowchart from facts to conclusion for complex elements (e.g., negligence tree: duty → breach → factual cause → proximate cause → damages)
- **Comparison tables**: side-by-side of two similar concepts (e.g., condition vs warranty, material breach vs minor breach)
- **Element checklists**: box-check format for complex offences or tests

## Flashcard-ready format

Append a flashcard block at the end of each topic:

```
FLASHCARD: [Topic]
Q: What are the elements of [rule]?
A: (1) [element 1]; (2) [element 2]; (3) [element 3].
Source: [statute/case]
```

These can be imported directly into Anki or similar spaced-repetition tools.

## Quality checks

- Every rule statement is complete (no shortcuts)
- Every case cited is real and the one-line significance is accurate
- Every exam pattern is genuinely tested, not hypothetical
- Memorization aids are accurate (a wrong mnemonic is worse than none)
- Jurisdiction callouts are present whenever the rule varies across jurisdictions

## Do not

- Do not fabricate case citations or statute numbers — flag gaps as "verify current version"
- Do not include rules from a different jurisdiction than specified without clearly labeling them
- Do not pad topics with academic debate that never appears on exams (unless the user specifically wants a research-oriented outline)
