# AI Governance Policy

## When to use this

Use this skill when an organization needs a formal AI governance policy to:
- Establish principles and rules for responsible AI use by employees and systems
- Comply with emerging AI regulations and data protection laws that apply to automated processing
- Satisfy investor, customer, or regulatory due diligence requirements
- Manage risk from AI-related harms (bias, discrimination, privacy violations, safety incidents)

Triggers: regulator inquiry, data protection audit, board request, procurement requirement, investor due diligence, or proactive compliance posture.

## Prompt template

> Draft an AI governance policy for [organization] that addresses responsible AI use, risk assessment framework, bias detection and mitigation, transparency requirements, human oversight mechanisms, data handling for AI training, vendor evaluation criteria, and incident response procedures.

Use [[conversation-clarifying-questions]] to elicit `[bracketed]` inputs before drafting.

---

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters |
|-------|---------------|
| Organization name and type | Regulatory requirements differ (financial institution vs. hospital vs. tech company) |
| Jurisdictions of operation | Determines which AI regulations and data protection laws apply |
| AI use cases in scope | Policy must be calibrated to actual risk — a chatbot has different risk than a credit-scoring model |
| Regulatory context | Is this for DIFC PDPL compliance? UAE AI Strategy? EU AI Act (for EU operations)? |

---

## Document structure

### 1. Purpose and scope
- Organization's commitment to responsible AI
- Definition of AI systems in scope (narrow: ML models producing decisions or outputs affecting individuals; broader: any automated processing tool)
- Who the policy applies to (employees, contractors, vendors)
- Relationship to other policies (data protection policy, acceptable use policy, vendor management policy)

### 2. AI risk classification framework
A tiered framework adapted to the organization's context:

| Risk tier | Criteria | Governance requirements |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| High risk | Decisions affecting individual rights, safety, access to services, employment, credit, healthcare | Mandatory human review; DPIA/AI impact assessment; formal approval before deployment |
| Medium risk | Significant business decisions; processing of personal data at scale | Impact assessment; documented testing; periodic review |
| Low risk | Content generation, internal productivity tools, no individual-facing decisions | Acceptable use guidelines; standard data handling |

For organizations with EU operations, map to EU AI Act risk categories (unacceptable / high / limited / minimal).

### 3. Responsible AI principles
State the organization's principles. Standard set:
- **Fairness**: AI systems must not produce discriminatory outputs based on protected characteristics
- **Transparency**: decisions made with AI assistance must be explainable to affected individuals on request
- **Privacy**: AI systems must comply with applicable data protection law; data minimization applies
- **Accountability**: every AI system must have a named owner responsible for governance
- **Safety**: AI systems must be tested before deployment; ongoing monitoring required
- **Human oversight**: high-risk AI decisions require human review before acting

### 4. Bias detection and mitigation
- Define "bias" in the organization's context (statistical bias, disparate impact, representational bias)
- Testing requirements before deployment: what tests are required, who conducts them, what threshold triggers remediation
- Ongoing monitoring: frequency; metrics to track; who reviews
- Remediation process: what happens when bias is detected post-deployment
- Training data governance: documentation of data sources, known limitations, exclusions

### 5. Transparency and explainability
- Individual rights: if an AI system makes or substantially informs a consequential decision about an individual, that individual has the right to explanation and to human review (required under GDPR Art. 22, UAE PDPL, DIFC Data Protection Law)
- Internal transparency: document what AI systems exist, what they do, and what data they use
- External transparency: disclosure obligations in terms of service or privacy notice

### 6. Human oversight mechanisms
- Define which decisions require human sign-off before acting on AI output
- Escalation path for borderline cases
- "Human in the loop" vs. "Human on the loop" distinction and when each applies
- Override rights: any individual affected by an AI decision has the right to request human review (mandatory in most data protection regimes)

### 7. Data handling for AI training
- Principles: purpose limitation (data collected for X may not be used to train AI without separate legal basis); data minimization; consent or legitimate interest assessment
- Training data sourcing: approved sources; prohibited categories (personal data of children; sensitive categories without explicit consent)
- Data retention for training sets: how long; deletion on model retirement
- Documentation: maintain a training data register

### 8. AI vendor evaluation criteria
Before procuring an AI system from a vendor:
- Does the vendor disclose training data sources and known limitations?
- What bias testing has the vendor conducted?
- What data does the vendor process and where is it stored? (Data residency requirements in UAE, KSA, EG)
- What is the vendor's incident response obligation?
- Does the vendor's AI use comply with applicable regulation?
- Contractual requirements: AI use restrictions, data processing agreement (DPA), audit rights, incident notification timelines

### 9. Incident response
- Definition of an AI incident: unauthorized output, harmful decision, bias event, data breach involving AI system, system failure
- Notification: who must be notified internally; regulatory notification requirements (UAE PDPL: 72-hour notification for data breaches; DIFC Data Protection Law: similar; GDPR: 72 hours)
- Containment: immediate steps to limit harm
- Investigation: root cause; was the incident foreseeable and preventable?
- Remediation: fix; affected individual notification; record
- Learning: post-incident review; policy update if required

### 10. Governance and accountability
- AI Governance Committee (or equivalent): composition; meeting frequency; mandate
- AI system owner responsibilities
- Annual policy review obligation
- Employee training requirements
- Non-compliance consequences

## Jurisdictional notes

### UAE
UAE Federal Decree-Law 45/2021 on Personal Data Protection applies to automated processing. No dedicated AI Act as of mid-2026, but the UAE AI Strategy 2031 sets national direction. Financial services AI governed by CBUAE and FSRA guidance. Healthcare AI: MOH guidance applies.

### KSA
Saudi PDPL (Personal Data Protection Law, Royal Decree M/19/2021) applies to automated decisions. SDAIA (Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority) is developing AI governance frameworks. Financial services: SAMA fintech frameworks apply to AI.

### DIFC
DIFC Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2020) includes automated processing provisions aligned with GDPR. DFSA has issued guidance on algorithmic systems in financial services.

### EU (if operations or EU data subjects)
EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) applies: mandatory risk classification, conformity assessments for high-risk AI, prohibited AI practices. Coordinate with EU AI Act timeline (phased implementation 2024–2027).

## Common mistakes

- Scope too broad: a policy covering "all software" is unmanageable; define AI systems precisely
- No accountability chain: policy states principles without naming who is responsible
- Missing vendor provisions: many AI risks enter through third-party tools
- Training data treated as anonymous: aggregated personal data is often still personal data; document the legal basis
- No update mechanism: AI regulation is evolving rapidly; include an annual review obligation
