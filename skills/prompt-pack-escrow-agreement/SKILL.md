# Escrow Agreement

## When to use this

Use this skill when drafting the three-party escrow agreement among a buyer, seller, and escrow agent that governs how a portion of M&A deal proceeds is held and released. Escrow arrangements are one of the most common deal protection mechanisms in M&A transactions: they provide the buyer with a funded source of recovery for post-closing warranty claims, without the difficulty of pursuing the seller for cash after the deal closes.

Typical triggers:
- SPA negotiated a warranty escrow (5–15% of deal price is typical)
- Specific known liability (tax claim, litigation, environmental) requires a dedicated escrow
- Sellers are individuals or offshore entities from whom post-closing recovery would be difficult
- W&I insurance has a retention/deductible that is backed by escrow

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| Escrow amount | The principal amount to be held | Ask |
| Escrow term | How long funds are held (typically 12–24 months for warranty escrow) | Ask; default 18 months |
| Escrow agent identity | The bank or trust company holding the funds | Ask |
| Governing law | Determines the legal framework for the arrangement | Ask |
| Release conditions | When and how funds are released to seller | Ask |
| Claim procedure | How buyer makes a claim against the escrow | Must be precisely defined; ask |

## Optional inputs

- Investment instructions (how the funds are invested while in escrow: bank deposit, money market, government securities)
- Escrow agent fees (flat fee, percentage of fund, or transactional)
- Multiple release tranches (partial releases at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months)
- Tax treatment of interest earned on escrow funds
- Dispute resolution mechanism for contested releases

## Document structure

### 1. Parties

- Buyer (the party with the right to claim against the escrow)
- Seller(s) (the party whose funds are held)
- Escrow Agent (the neutral custodian — typically a regulated bank or escrow company)

### 2. Establishment of Escrow

- Escrow amount deposited at closing: state the amount and currency
- Funding mechanism: wire transfer to the escrow agent's designated account on the closing date
- The escrow agent acknowledges receipt and confirms the escrow account is established

### 3. Escrow Term and Release

The most heavily negotiated section:

**Standard warranty escrow release schedule**:
- **First release**: At the end of the general warranty survival period (typically 12–24 months after closing); amount released = escrow fund minus any pending claims
- **Final release**: At the later of: (a) the end of the warranty survival period; or (b) final resolution of all pending claims
- **Specific warranty / tax escrow**: May have a longer survival period (3–7 years for tax warranties); remainder released when the extended period expires

**Release mechanics**:
> "The Escrow Agent shall release the Remaining Escrow Amount to the Seller on receipt of a Joint Release Instruction from both Buyer and Seller, or an enforceable court order or arbitral award."

Define: What is a "Joint Release Instruction"? (A written instruction signed by authorized representatives of both parties)

**Contested releases**: If the Buyer has filed a claim notice before the release date, the portion equal to the claimed amount (plus a reasonable buffer) is retained until the claim is resolved; the balance is released to the Seller.

### 4. Buyer's Right to Make Claims

Define the claim procedure precisely:

1. **Claim Notice**: Buyer delivers a written Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent and Seller, specifying: the nature of the claim; the relevant warranty or indemnity provision in the SPA; the amount claimed (specifying best estimate if unliquidated).

2. **Response period**: Seller has [20–30] business days to deliver a Dispute Notice objecting to the claim. If no Dispute Notice is received, the claim is deemed accepted and the Escrow Agent releases the claimed amount to Buyer.

3. **Disputed claims**: If a Dispute Notice is received, the claimed amount is retained in escrow pending resolution by: (a) mutual agreement evidenced by a Joint Release Instruction; or (b) a final, binding decision of [the applicable arbitral tribunal / court].

4. **Minimum claim threshold**: Often the SPA specifies that buyer cannot claim until individual claims exceed a de minimis threshold (e.g., USD 50,000) and aggregate claims exceed a basket/deductible.

### 5. Escrow Agent's Role and Obligations

The escrow agent is a neutral custodian:
- Holds funds in trust; has no beneficial interest
- Acts only on Joint Release Instructions or enforceable court orders
- Must verify the identity and authorization of signatories before releasing funds
- Is not responsible for disputes between buyer and seller; its role is ministerial
- Entitled to resign on notice; replacement escrow agent must be agreed by buyer and seller

**Escrow agent protections**:
- No liability for following instructions that appear genuine and are in proper form
- No obligation to verify the underlying merits of a buyer's claim
- Right to apply to a court for directions if instructions are contradictory or unclear
- Indemnified by buyer and seller for costs incurred in its role (except for gross negligence or fraud)

### 6. Investment of Escrow Funds

Specify how the funds are invested while in escrow:
- Default: overnight bank deposit in a segregated account with [escrow bank]
- Optional: money market funds; short-term government securities (with buyer/seller joint instruction)
- Interest / income earned: allocated to [seller] (most common — seller retains the economic benefit while the escrow is held, unless a claim is made) subject to payment of taxes
- Tax reporting: escrow agent will report interest income to [seller] for tax purposes

### 7. Fees and Expenses

- Escrow agent's fees: [amount per year / percentage of fund]; payable by [buyer / seller / equally split]
- Out-of-pocket expenses (legal fees for disputed instructions, bank transfer fees): allocated between parties or paid from escrow fund

### 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

- Governing law: typically the law of the jurisdiction where the escrow agent is located or where the main SPA is governed
- Disputes about the escrow agreement itself (other than the underlying SPA claims): arbitration or courts
- The escrow agreement should not conflict with the dispute resolution clause in the SPA

## Jurisdictional notes

| Jurisdiction | Escrow structure | Key considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **DIFC** | Common-law trust arrangement; escrow agents are licensed under DIFC law | DIFC Courts can issue freezing injunctions over escrow funds if disputed; robust enforcement |
| **UAE onshore** | UAE banks act as escrow agents; escrow concept recognized under UAE Civil Transactions Law | For UAE deals, the escrow account is typically held with a UAE bank (Emirates NBD, ADCB, FAB); certified Arabic escrow agreement recommended |
| **KSA** | Escrow through Saudi banks; regulated by SAMA | Saudi law escrow agreements; Saudi banks have internal escrow departments for commercial transactions |
| **Lebanon** | Historically difficult due to banking crisis; escrow outside Lebanon (Cyprus, France, UAE) is common for Lebanon deals | Post-2019 banking crisis, Lebanese bank escrows are not reliable; use offshore escrow |
| **ADGM / UK** | Common-law escrow; established law and practice | SRA-regulated law firms can act as escrow agents in the UK; ADGM entities use ADGM-regulated escrow services |

## Common mistakes

- **Vague release conditions**: An escrow agreement that says "funds released when the parties agree" without specifying the claim procedure creates a standoff that requires litigation to resolve.
- **No dispute resolution for contested releases**: Without a mechanism for resolving disputes when the buyer and seller cannot agree on a release, the escrow becomes a de facto permanent holdback.
- **Wrong escrow agent**: Using an unregulated entity or the law firm's client account as escrow is unprofessional and creates risk; use a regulated bank or licensed escrow agent.
- **Failure to address interest tax**: Interest earned on the escrow account during the holding period has tax implications; failure to address this leads to disputes about who bears the tax on interest income.
- **No provision for escrow agent resignation**: If the escrow agent withdraws from the market or the relationship breaks down, there must be a mechanism to appoint a successor.
