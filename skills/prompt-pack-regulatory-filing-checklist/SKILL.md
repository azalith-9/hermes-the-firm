# Regulatory Filing Checklist

## When to use this

Use this skill when:
- A company secretary or compliance officer needs a master checklist of all regulatory filings due in a given calendar year.
- A new entity has been incorporated and the team needs to understand ongoing filing obligations from day one.
- A company is being audited or is in M&A due diligence and needs to verify that all statutory filings are current.
- A company has recently changed status (e.g., converted from LLC to PJSC, added a new subsidiary, changed its auditor) and needs to understand the change-notification filings triggered.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity type** | LLC, PJSC, free-zone company, branch, partnership, foundation — each has distinct obligations | Ask before drafting |
| **Jurisdiction(s) of incorporation and operation** | Filing obligations differ materially across UAE onshore, DIFC, ADGM, KSA, LB, EG | Ask; do not assume |
| **Licensed activities** | Financial services, healthcare, and real estate companies have sector-specific filing obligations in addition to corporate filings | Ask if regulated sector |
| **Financial year-end** | Determines specific calendar deadlines for accounts filing and tax returns | Default: 31 December; adjust if different |

## Optional inputs

- **Beneficial ownership (UBO) profile** — needed to assess UBO register obligations across jurisdictions.
- **Group structure** — parent company or subsidiaries can trigger consolidated reporting obligations.
- **Current compliance status** — whether any filings are overdue (affects urgency prioritization).

## Document structure (checklist output)

The checklist should be organized as a table or structured list with the following columns:
- **Filing / Notification type**
- **Regulatory authority**
- **Deadline** (specific date or trigger event + window)
- **Frequency** (annual, biannual, event-triggered)
- **Responsible party** (company secretary, CFO, legal counsel)
- **Penalty for late/non-filing**
- **Status** (to be completed by the client)

## Drafting standards

- Present the checklist as a live document the client can fill in and use as a compliance tracker.
- Always note: "Deadlines are subject to change by regulatory circular; verify with official sources before use."
- Add a "Last verified" date to the checklist so the client knows when it was prepared.
- Flag entries where the penalty for non-compliance is particularly severe or where late filing triggers automatic licence suspension.
- For regulated entities (financial services, healthcare, real estate), include a note that sector-specific filings are not exhaustive in the corporate filing checklist — a separate sector compliance calendar is needed.

## Common mistakes

- **Treating free zone and mainland deadlines as identical.** DIFC, ADGM, DMCC, JAFZA each have their own registrar and their own deadlines — do not consolidate.
- **Missing UBO / beneficial ownership register obligations.** These are frequently overlooked and carry significant penalties across all MENA jurisdictions.
- **Assuming the same financial year-end across jurisdictions.** A group may have different year-ends in different jurisdictions; verify per entity.
- **Omitting sector-specific filings.** A corporate checklist covers Companies Law obligations; a bank, insurance company, or listed entity has a separate layer of prudential / market-conduct filings.
