# Trade Secret Protection Policy

## When to use this

Use this skill when a company needs to draft, review, or update the internal governance policy that operationalizes trade secret protection. This is the companion document to an NDA — the NDA binds outside parties; the trade secret policy governs insiders (employees, contractors, interns) and processes. Typical triggers:

- Pre-IPO or M&A due diligence reveals no documented trade secret policy (a common deal risk flag)
- A company is establishing R&D operations in a MENA jurisdiction and needs a policy that will hold up under local law
- An employee departure or suspected misappropriation prompts a reactive audit
- External counsel advises that "reasonable measures" to protect secrets are not sufficiently documented for litigation

A well-drafted policy is essential to establish the "reasonable measures" element required to claim trade secret protection under virtually every jurisdiction's statute or case law.

## Required inputs

| Input | Why it matters | Sensible default |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Company name and industry | Industry shapes the types of trade secrets and common threat vectors | Prompt user |
| Jurisdictions of operation | Determines applicable statute and enforcement mechanisms | All jurisdictions where company has employees or operations |
| Categories of trade secrets | Policy cannot protect secrets it doesn't define | Prompt user to enumerate; see structure §1 below |
| Employee / contractor population | Scope of who must sign and comply | All employees, consultants, officers, and seconded staff |
| IT systems in scope | Defines the digital perimeter | All company-owned and BYOD devices, cloud services, collaboration tools |

## Optional inputs

- **Existing NDA / employment contract clauses** — policy should be consistent with existing contractual obligations
- **Classification system** (e.g., Confidential / Highly Confidential / Public) — enables tiered access controls
- **Regulatory context** (e.g., sector-specific data protection requirements) — financial data, health data, government contracts may have additional statutory overlays
- **Incident history** — prior leaks inform the tailored controls section
- **Third-party relationships** (JV partners, suppliers with access to IP) — extends the policy's reach

## Document structure

1. **Purpose and scope** — explains why the policy exists; defines who it applies to (employees, contractors, temps, officers, third parties with system access); states it is a condition of employment/engagement
2. **Definition of trade secrets** — enumerate categories: formulas and processes, technical specifications, source code, financial models, customer lists and pricing, business strategies, personnel information, pending patent applications, undisclosed product roadmaps; include a catch-all clause ("any other information that the Company treats as confidential and which derives independent economic value from its secrecy")
3. **Classification system** — three-tier: (a) Public, (b) Confidential (internal use only), (c) Highly Confidential / Trade Secret (need-to-know basis); include marking requirements for documents, emails, and files
4. **Identification and inventory** — procedure for identifying and registering trade secrets in a central register; assigned ownership (business unit head); annual review cycle
5. **Access controls** — least-privilege principle; role-based access; mandatory approval workflow for elevated access; prohibition on storing trade secrets on personal devices or unauthorized cloud services
6. **Employee obligations** — duty of confidentiality during and after employment; use restrictions (only for authorized company purposes); notification obligation upon discovery of unauthorized access or disclosure; post-termination non-use obligations (note: non-compete enforceability varies sharply by jurisdiction)
7. **Third-party sharing protocols** — all sharing requires: (a) NDA in place, (b) manager approval, (c) minimum necessary disclosure, (d) log entry in sharing register; vendor DPA required if sharing involves personal data
8. **Physical security** — clean-desk policy; locked storage for printed materials; visitor escort procedures; secure destruction requirements (cross-cut shredding, certified electronic destruction)
9. **Digital security** — encryption at rest and in transit; DRM for sensitive documents; audit trails on access; prohibition on unapproved AI/cloud tools that may ingest trade secrets (critical for MENA firms where sovereign data concerns apply)
10. **Incident response** — suspected misappropriation: immediate notification to legal / CISO; evidence preservation instructions; cooperation with investigation; potential law enforcement referral
11. **Monitoring and enforcement** — company's right to monitor systems; consequences of violation (disciplinary action up to termination; civil and criminal referral); whistleblower protection for good-faith reports
12. **Training** — mandatory onboarding training; annual refresher; acknowledgment log
13. **Governing law and enforcement** — identifies the applicable trade secret statute by jurisdiction (see table below); notes remedies (injunctions, damages, criminal prosecution)
14. **Policy maintenance** — annual review; version control; legal sign-off requirement

## Jurisdictional notes

| Jurisdiction | Key instrument | Notable points |
|---|---|---|
| UAE (onshore) | Federal Decree-Law No. 31/2021 (Crimes and Penalties) + Commercial Transactions Law; DIFC: Contract Law + Common Law | Criminal liability for trade secret theft under UAE Penal Code; injunctive relief available; "reasonable measures" not separately defined but courts look to contractual obligations as evidence |
| DIFC / ADGM | Common law; DIFC Contract Law; ADGM companies may rely on English common law of confidentiality | Springboard doctrine applies (prevents unjust enrichment from misappropriated secrets); courts will grant urgent injunctions |
| KSA | Commercial Court Law; Regulatory framework under ZATCA and SAGIA; no standalone trade secret act — protection via contract and unfair competition principles | Employment contracts must include confidentiality clauses; Saudi courts enforce injunctions but enforcement timelines can be lengthy; Arabic employment contract prevails |
| Lebanon | Code of Obligations and Contracts (Art. 230-233 on tort); Industrial Property Law No. 240/2000 | Criminal penalties for industrial espionage; civil damages; no standalone trade secret statute — relies on tort and contract |
| Egypt | Intellectual Property Law No. 82/2002 (Part III — Trade Secrets and Undisclosed Information) | Explicitly recognizes trade secrets as protectable; requires "reasonable measures"; civil and criminal remedies; Cairo courts active in injunction practice |
| EU | Trade Secrets Directive 2016/943 (transposed into national law) | Harmonized definition: (i) secret, (ii) commercial value, (iii) reasonable steps taken; national transpositions vary on remedies |
| UK | Common law of confidentiality; Trade Secrets (Enforcement, etc.) Regulations 2018 (post-Brexit adoption of EU Directive) | "Springboard" doctrine; breach of confidence action; "reasonable steps" required |
| US | Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) 2016 + state laws (most follow Uniform Trade Secrets Act) | Federal civil cause of action; ex parte seizure orders available; criminal prosecution under Economic Espionage Act |

**MENA trap — post-termination non-competes:** Non-compete covenants are enforceable in UAE and KSA if limited in duration (typically ≤ 2 years) and geographic scope and if the employee had access to genuine trade secrets. Lebanon and Egypt place tighter limits on duration. Courts in all MENA civil-law jurisdictions will reduce unreasonably broad restrictions. The trade secret policy should state that non-compete obligations are governed by employment contracts (not this policy alone).

**AI tools trap:** Employees using public AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) may inadvertently disclose trade secrets. Policy must explicitly list prohibited uses of external AI tools and require legal/IT approval for any approved AI tool that processes company data.

## Drafting standards

- **Define "reasonable measures" explicitly** — regulators and courts in all jurisdictions require concrete protective measures; a vague policy offers minimal legal protection
- **Tiered classification** must map to concrete access controls — if all confidential information is in one bucket, the policy lacks operational meaning
- **Acknowledgment requirement** — every employee and contractor must sign an acknowledgment upon hire and annually; retain records for at least 7 years (or the applicable limitation period)
- **Post-termination reminders** — exit checklist should include: device return, deletion of company data from personal devices, reminder letter of confidentiality obligations; document this process
- Do not use US-style "work product" or DTSA-specific language as the operative framework if the governing jurisdiction is civil law — translate concepts to the applicable statute

## Common mistakes

- **No classification system** — protection is easier to demonstrate if information is visibly marked as confidential
- **Policy not signed by employees** — unsigned policy provides weak evidentiary foundation
- **AI tool gaps** — omitting AI tools from "prohibited disclosure channels" is now the most frequent gap
- **Broad non-compete drafted inside the policy** — non-compete obligations belong in employment contracts, not internal policies; a policy clause may not be independently enforceable
- **No incident response procedure** — missing this makes forensic investigation and litigation harder
- **Single language** — in KSA and UAE, an Arabic version (or a bilingual version with Arabic governing) is necessary for the policy to be enforceable against Arabic-speaking employees in labor proceedings
