# UN Consolidated Sanctions List

## What it does

This tool screens counterparties, individuals, vessels, and aircraft against the United Nations Security Council Consolidated List — the authoritative multilateral sanctions database maintained by the UN Security Council Committee pursuant to its resolutions.

The UN list is the **baseline** for any sanctions screening regime. Every GCC central bank directly mirrors the UN Consolidated List:
- CBUAE (UAE Central Bank)
- SAMA (Saudi Central Bank)
- BDL (Banque du Liban — Lebanon)
- CBI (Central Bank of Iraq)
- CBK (Central Bank of Kuwait)
- CBO (Central Bank of Oman)
- CBB (Central Bank of Bahrain)
- QCB (Qatar Central Bank)

Accordingly, entities on the UN list are automatically blocked in all GCC jurisdictions. MENA-region compliance programs that screen only OFAC and EU lists but miss UN designations are non-compliant.

## UN Sanctions Programs

The UN Security Council operates multiple sanctions programs:

| Resolution(s) | Program | Targets | MENA relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1267/1989/2253 | ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida | Terrorism / ISIS / AQ affiliates | High — active designations across MENA |
| 2140 | Yemen | Houthi leaders, spoilers of peace process | High — active Yemen conflict |
| 1737/1747/1803/2231 | Iran | Nuclear / ballistic missile program | Very high — Iran-adjacent transactions |
| 1718/2270/2321 | DPRK | North Korea | Relevant for shipping / logistics |
| 1970/1973 | Libya | Libya arms embargo, listed individuals | Moderate |
| 1591 | Darfur/Sudan | Sudan-specific individuals | Lower |
| 2374 | Mali | Mali peace process spoilers | Relevant for OHADA / Francophone Africa |
| 2048 | Guinea-Bissau | Coup leaders | Limited MENA relevance |
| Various | Central African Republic | Arms embargo | Limited MENA relevance |
| 1572 | Côte d'Ivoire | (Delisted 2016; watch for residual) | Historical |

For MENA-region transactions, the **ISIL/Al-Qaida list** and **Yemen list** are the highest-priority programs. The Iran program must be cross-referenced with OFAC, which has more comprehensive Iran sanctions.

## Setup / auth

No API key required. The UN publishes its Consolidated List publicly:
- **XML feed**: https://scsanctions.un.org/resources/xml/en/consolidated.xml (updated as designations are added/removed)
- **CSV/spreadsheet**: available on the UN Security Council website
- **RESTful API**: via https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/un-sc-consolidated-list

The tool maintains a local cached copy refreshed at least daily. For real-time payment screening, the cache should refresh hourly.

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `name` | Full name of individual or entity | Conditional |
| `nameAr` | Arabic name (if available) | Conditional |
| `dob` | Date of birth (individual) | Optional — improves accuracy |
| `nationality` | Country code | Optional |
| `imoNumber` | Vessel IMO number (for vessel screening) | Conditional |
| `entityType` | `individual` / `entity` / `vessel` / `aircraft` | Recommended |
| `minScore` | Minimum match score to flag (0–100), default 75 | No |

## Capabilities

### Name screening
```
Input:  {
  name: "Mohammad Hassan Al-Zawahiri",
  nameAr: "محمد حسن الزواهري",
  dob: "1970-01-15",
  nationality: "EG",
  entityType: "individual"
}
Output: {
  hits: [
    {
      unId: "QDi.001",
      name: "ZAWAHIRI, Ayman Mohammed Rabie",
      programs: ["QDi"],
      aliases: [...],
      dob: "1951-06-19",
      nationality: "EG",
      score: 71
    }
  ],
  cleared: true,
  note: "Possible name-only partial match; DOB mismatch reduces confidence"
}
```

### Entity screening
```
Input:  {
  name: "Al-Nusra Finance Ltd",
  entityType: "entity",
  country: "SY"
}
Output: { hits: [...], cleared: false }
```

### Vessel screening
```
Input:  { imoNumber: "9320187", entityType: "vessel" }
Output: { hits: [...], flagState, operator }
```
IMO numbers are matched exactly for vessels. Vessel name matches are fuzzy.

### Bulk screening
For KYC onboarding batches — screen a list of counterparties in a single call:
```
Input:  { batch: [{ name, dob, nationality }, ...] }
Output: { results: [{ input, hits, cleared }] }
```

## Match rules

Arabic names present specific matching challenges:

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Transliteration variants | Muhammad / Mohammed / Mohamad / Muhamad all match to "محمد" |
| Definiteness (al-/el-) | "Al-Hassan" and "Hassan" are normalized |
| Kunya / nisba | "Abu Musab" (father of) and "Al-Zarqawi" (from Zarqa) require fuzzy matching |
| Female names with father's name | "Fatima bint Khalid" — split and match each component |
| DOB tolerance | ±2 years (per standard practice for Arabic names where exact DOB is often uncertain) |

## Three-list screening standard

For any commercial transaction, the minimum standard is a three-list screen:

| List | Tool | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| UN Consolidated List | This tool | Mandatory for all GCC transactions; baseline |
| US OFAC SDN List | [[tool-ofac-sanctions]] | Required for any USD payment or US-person nexus |
| EU Sanctions List | tool-eu-sanctions (separate skill) | Required for any EUR payment or EU-person nexus |

Additional lists for specific sectors:
- UK sanctions (OFSI list) — for UK-person nexus post-Brexit
- FATF grey/black list — country-level risk, not individual designation
- Local AML watchlists — SAMA / CBUAE / BDL internal lists (not public)

## GCC central bank mirror requirement

GCC central banks issue circulars requiring all supervised financial institutions to:
1. Maintain current copies of the UN, OFAC, and EU lists
2. Screen all customers and transactions in real-time or near-real-time
3. Freeze assets of any designated person immediately upon designation
4. Report matches to the relevant FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit)

**SAMA (KSA)**: AML/CTF Law and implementing regulations require list screening at onboarding and on an ongoing basis.

**CBUAE (UAE)**: Cabinet Decision No. 74 of 2020 (on Countering Money Laundering) and CBUAE AML/CFT Standards require financial institutions to screen against the UN list and implement automated transaction monitoring.

**BDL (Lebanon)**: BDL Circular 126 requires banks to maintain and screen against UN, OFAC, and EU lists. Lebanon's FATF-flagged status means enhanced scrutiny from international correspondent banks.

## Output schema

```json
{
  "screeningId": "un-2026-05-14-001",
  "subject": {
    "name": "Mohammad Hassan",
    "dob": "1970-01-15",
    "nationality": "EG"
  },
  "hits": [],
  "cleared": true,
  "programs_checked": ["QDi", "ISTAQi", "Yemen", "Iran", "DPRK", "Libya"],
  "checkDate": "2026-05-14",
  "listVersion": "UN Consolidated List — 2026-05-10",
  "recommendation": "CLEAR — no UN consolidated list match found"
}
```

## Failure modes

| Failure | Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Stale list cache | Last refresh > 24 hours | Force refresh before screening |
| XML parse error | Malformed UN list XML | Fall back to CSV; report to admin |
| Common name ambiguity | Multiple high-score hits | Require additional identifiers |
| Arabic name not found | Zero results on Arabic query | Try transliteration variants |
| Vessel flag state unknown | Vessel match without flag data | Cross-reference with IMO ship register |
